	sessionStorage.setItem("TRAIND", "1-800 CONTACTS PRIVACY POLICY Effective 2/14/2013. Here are the basics: We will treat your information the same way we'd treat our own. We won’t sell your information, we won’t use your information to spam you to death, and most importantly, we will do everything we can to make sure your information is secure. Additionally, you can unsubscribe at any time—no hard feelings. If that was too basic, keep reading for the page-turning legal version! So what’s in this Privacy Policy? This policy describes the personal information 1-800 CONTACTS collects, why we collect it, and how we use it. This policy also describes your options concerning how we collect and use your information. If our information practices change in the future, don’t worry—we will notify you by posting the policy changes directly to this web page before any changes are implemented. At 1-800 CONTACTS, Inc., we value you and respect your privacy, that is why we only collect your information for three purposes: 1) to improve your shopping experience; 2) to process your order (including verification of your prescription, if necessary and with your authorization); and 3) to keep you up-to-date regarding optical goods, ocular health, and even some awesome promotions. Don’t worry, we will maintain and use your information responsibly. We promise. And we won't sell, rent, or loan any of your information to any third party. In other words, that junk mail you just got was not because of us! What kind of information does 1-800 CONTACTS collect? We collect personal information that you provide (such as name, mailing address, phone number, email address, credit card number, patient’s name (if different from your own), contact lens prescription, and the name and phone number of the eye care provider) when placing an order, registering with us, or participating in a promotion. We also maintain a record of your past purchases. Our information systems are also fully integrated which means after your first order, regardless of how you ordered (phone, web, etc.), we can look you up in a snap. Currently, we also use third-party service providers to track and analyze non-personally identifiable information about our visitors and customers. We use this information to improve our site and plan for technical improvements. This information may also be used by our third party service providers to direct advertising content on other web sites. For more information about this type of advertising visit www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp. All data collected by our service providers on behalf of 1-800 CONTACTS is owned and used solely for the benefit of 1-800 CONTACTS. We reserve the right to publish non-personally identifiable summary information regarding our website visitors for promotional purposes and as a representative audience for advertisers. Please note that this is not personal information, it only consists of general summaries of the activities of our visitors and customers. How does 1-800 CONTACTS use my information? First, we use your personal information to fulfill your orders. Second, we use it to confirm your order (or contact you if we have any questions regarding your order). Third, we may contact you (either directly or through a service provider bound by strict confidentiality) to help us learn more about your shopping preferences so that we may better serve you. Fourth, we may use your information to help us better improve our site design and your shopping experience. Finally, we may send you notices about our products, services, contests, surveys and promotions or news about contact lenses, optical goods, or ocular health. Does 1-800 CONTACTS share my information with third partie ?We do not share your personal information with any third or outside party, except to verify your prescription, as explained in the next bodycopy. If you opt to receive no commercial email from us, we will add your email address to a “do not mail” list, which may be given to trusted outside parties in order to ensure your email address is excluded from any third-party email distribution. We do not sell, rent or loan any information about you to any third parties. PLEASE NOTE: On all orders placed, we do attempt to verify or obtain a copy of your contact lens prescription from the eye care provider that you designate. This information is held under the same strict confidentiality standards as described above and in accordance with all applicable laws. This privacy policy shall also govern your information for all successors, assigns, and/or affiliates of 1-800 CONTACTS. How do I access my information? How do I update my information? After you register, you can access your account online by clicking the “My Account” link at the top of any of the pages on www.1800contacts.com. Here you can edit your billing, shipping, email preferences, login information and password settings. You can also make these changes by calling us at 1-800 CONTACTS (1-800-266-8228) to speak with a Customer Service Representative. How do I remove my information from email, postal mailing and telephone lists? To change your email preferences, click the “My Account” link and then click “Account Settings & Password.” You can also call one of our Customer Service Representatives at 1-800 CONTACTS (1-800-266-8228).

PLEASE NOTE: Requests to be removed from the postal mail list may take up to 6-8 weeks to process. Sorry about that. Also, if you remove your name and address from our email or postal mailing lists, we will maintain your name in a “do not mail” file to ensure that we can honor your request. When you make a purchase, we will send you an email to confirm your order, and send an email when your order is shipped. We may also need to contact you via phone, postal mail or email if we have other questions regarding your order. How does 1-800 CONTACTS protect my child’s privacy? We take children’s safety seriously. Consistent with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998, we will never request personally identifiable information from anyone under the age of 13. If we are aware or learn that a subscriber is under the age of 13 and has registered without prior verifiable parental consent, we will remove his or her personally identifiable registration information from our files. How does 1-800 CONTACTS make sure my order information is secure? Protecting your order information is a priority for us. We use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology to protect the security of your online order information. More than 90% of Fortune 500 companies use SSL security to protect their sensitive personal and financial information, so you know it’s “the good stuff.” To check the security of your connection, look at the lower corner of your browser window after accessing the server. If you see an unbroken key or a closed lock (depending on your browser), the SSL is active and the server is secure. You can also double-check by looking at the URL line of your browser. When assessing a secure server, the first characters of the site address will change from “http://” to “https://”. When you use our ordering page you can be assured that your sensitive personal information and financial transactions with us are encrypted, safe, and secure. Does 1-800 CONTACTS use adware or spyware? What is adware? What is spyware? Adware is software that is installed on your computer that can, for example, create pop-up advertisements or cause your browser to be redirected to other websites. We do not participate in or use third-party services that use adware. We believe this type of advertising could be confusing for some customers. We work to ensure that these third-party adware services do not function on our website. Spyware is software that is installed on your computer that can, for example, record and transmit information regarding the websites you visit or record and transmit your keystrokes to a third party. In addition to being super creepy, we wouldn’t want that software used on us. So we don’t want it used on you. Spyware, like adware, is often installed without the knowledge of the person using the computer. We do not use spyware and we work to ensure that spyware does not function on our website either. What are cookies? How does 1-800 CONTACTS use cookies on its site? Some cookies are round, delicious treats—best when served hot out of the oven. These are not the cookies we use. The cookies we use are small files stored on your computer's hard drive that contain information that is used to track the pages of the sites you've visited. We use cookies to improve your shopping experience. When you visit our website, your cookie helps us keep track of your order as you shop at our site. If you are a registered customer, your cookie allows us to recognize you when you return to our site and provides you with access to your account information. If you register with or order from us, we also use cookies to maintain information about your use of our website in a manner that identifies you as a customer. This information helps us serve you better by improving our site design, as well as our services, contests, surveys and promotions. Even though we would share our cookies with you, you don’t need to share your cookies with us. Just turn them off in your web browser. However, if you turn your cookies off, we will not be able to track your order, enable your purchase from our site, or recognize you as a registered user to allow you access to your account information. Is this the end of the Privacy Policy? Yep. Great job! You made it to the end! Unless you have any questions… If you do have any questions about our Privacy Policy, please contact us via: Email:info@1800contacts.com.

ACM recognizes the interest of its members and customers in the confidentiality of their personal information. ACM only maintains personal information that is relevant to ACM activities and seeks to maintain accurate, complete, and timely information. The security of personal information is important to ACM. ACM maintains all personal data with technical, administrative, and physical safeguards to protect against loss, unauthorized access, destruction, misuse, modification, and improper disclosure. No computer system or information can ever be fully protected against every possible hazard. ACM provides reasonable and appropriate security controls to protect personal information against foreseeable hazards. ACM maintains member databases that contain mailing, billing, and member profile information, as well as a record of each member's product and service purchases. ACM also maintains databases of member and non-member purchases and of registrations for conferences and other ACM activities. The information in these databases is used by authorized ACM staff members to process orders; mail invoices, purchases, renewal notices, and announcements; respond to member inquiries; and help us improve our offerings. Member records are maintained as long as an individual is an ACM member and for two years following a membership lapse. Purchases and credit card transactions are retained for as long as appropriate to meet contractual, tax, or auditing needs. All personally identifiable information contained in ACM membership, purchase, and registration databases is treated as confidential and will be used only for the purposes stated in this policy, except where required by law. Just like any other record keeper, ACM may be required to disclose personal information in response to valid legal process. This includes a search warrant, subpoena, or court order. Disclosures may also be appropriate to protect ACM's legal rights or during emergencies if physical safety is believed to be at risk. These disclosures are possible although unlikely. Personal data about ACM members and customers may, from time to time, be collected or shared with outside contractors, auditors, consultants, and others hired by ACM to assist in carrying out financial or operational activities. ACM informs recipients about safeguarding personal information, and requires them to use it only for an authorized purpose consistent with this privacy policy, and to return it or destroy it upon completion of the activity.

ACM Web Site This policy applies to the acm.org Web site maintained by ACM. Other than in the restricted-access portions of ACM's site that requires an ACM Web Account, ACM does not log the identity of visitors. However, we may keep access logs, for example containing a visitor's IP address and search queries. We may analyze log files periodically to help maintain and improve our Web site and enforce our online service polices. Cookies are only set when users visit restricted portions of our website. Raw log files are treated as confidential and retained for no longer than two years. On some pages of our site we allow individuals to submit information for the purposes of joining ACM; renewing or updating their membership; ordering products and services; or registering for a conference, contest, or other activity. Information collected on these pages will be used according to ACM's Privacy Policy.       ACM Web Account Policy Some portions of the ACM Web site, specifically the ACM Digital Library, require an ACM Web Account for both members and visitors. To create an account, ACM members and customers must provide their name, ACM member number (if applicable), and email address. They are assigned a username (which they may change) and asked to create a password and provide the day and month of their birth (for account verification purposes). Customers must setup an ACM Web account in order to use the Search facility in the ACM Digital Library. Non-members are asked for their name, email address, and postal address when they create their account. By default, ACM may send information about ACM products and services to non-member ACM Web account holders via email. Customers may request that they not receive such information via email. Information collected about ACM Web account usage -- including logs of Web pages visited, searches performed, and Digital Library content downloaded -- will be stored in an anonymized form and used to improve the ACM Digital Library and other ACM Web offerings.

Obviously, however, this does not include selling, renting, sharing, or otherwise disclosing personally identifiable information from customers for commercial purposes in violation of the commitments set forth in this Privacy Notice. With Your Consent: Other than as set out above, you will receive notice when information about you might go to third parties, and you will have an opportunity to choose not to share the information. How Secure Is Information About Me? We work to protect the security of your information during transmission by using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software, which encrypts information you input. We reveal only the last four digits of your credit card numbers when confirming an order. Of course, we transmit the entire credit card number to the appropriate credit card company during order processing.

American gets this information by using technologies, including cookies, pixel tags, and web beacons, to increase the functionality and user-friendliness of our site and to better tailor our site, products, and services to our visitors' needs. We also use this information to verify that visitors meet the criteria required to process their requests and for reporting onsite activity in the aggregate. For example, we may want to know how long the average user spends on our site or which pages or features get the most attention. Cookies on the American Airlines website We use cookies to ensure that we give you the best possible experience on our website. We also use cookies to show you advertising that is relevant to you.

Most browsers have options that allow the visitor to control whether the browser will accept cookies, reject cookies, or notify the visitor each time a cookie is sent. You may elect to reject cookies by adjusting your browser's settings, but doing so will limit the range of features available to the visitor on our website and most other major websites that use cookies.

Return to Top Minors Due to the nature of our services, travel purchase information, which may include personally identifiable information, may be collected by American from children under the age of 13 when it is necessary to comply with the law, including federal aviation or security regulations, or as otherwise necessary for American to provide transportation needs and services.  We may retain personally identifiable information when necessary to provide transportation and related services to a child under the age of 13.  American does not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13 other than when necessary to comply with the law or for safety and security reasons.   If you are a parent or guardian of someone under the age of 13 who has provided us information without your knowledge and consent, you may request that we remove this information by emailing Privacy@aa.com. Return to Top Security When you buy an American Airlines ticket or access your AAdvantage® account over the World Wide Web, your web browser connects with the website through SSL (Secure Sockets Layer). SSL is an industry-standard way to send personal information over the Internet. SSL ensures you are actually sending data to American Airlines and not someone who claims to be American Airlines. Look for one or more of these indicators on your browser to ensure you have a secure connection:  A security alert window tells you that you are about to use a secure connection. Some browsers let you choose whether to display this window. While American Airlines reasonably attempts to safeguard and to prevent unauthorized access to your private information including, without limitation, your personally identifiable information, we cannot be responsible for the acts of those who gain unauthorized access, and we make no warranty, express, implied, or otherwise, that we will prevent unauthorized access to your private information.

Administrative and Analytical Purposes In addition to processing, confirming and fulfilling the travel or other services you request, American may use customer information for administrative and analytical purposes such as information systems management, accounting, billing and audits, marketing, credit card processing and verification, customer-relations correspondence, and/or operation of the AAdvantage® program.  American also uses customer information to identify, develop and market products and services that we believe you will value.  Legal Requirements Please note that the laws and regulations of several countries may require us to provide foreign and domestic government agencies with access to the data you disclose to us and data that we have about you and your travel plans, history, or status.  Further, to the extent required by law, we may disclose personally identifiable information to government authorities, or to third parties pursuant to a subpoena or other legal process, and we may also use or disclose your information as permitted by law to protect the rights or property of American, our customers, our website, or its users.  With Whom Your Information Will be Shared American does not sell any customer information or share your personal information with third parties except in compliance with this policy. However, we may disclose customer information to companies affiliated with American and/or unaffiliated third parties to fulfill the products and services you have requested and to process your information for our own administrative and analytical purposes. We may also disclose this information to third parties, such as employers, who have arranged for discounts, purchased travel or other services on your behalf. Additionally, American may combine the information we receive from you with information collected from other sources. This information may be used to provide offers and/or services specifically tailored to your interests. From time to time, you may receive offers from affiliated American companies such as AMR Investments, American Eagle, AAdvantage® participants, American Airlines Vacations, and AmericanConnection® or from carefully-selected third party companies with which we have a business relationship. In addition, we may provide information we collect about you to third-parties to distribute promotions, sweepstakes, marketing surveys, focus groups, interviews and other opportunities offered by American. These third-parties are subject to stringent data security and confidentiality requirements and, upon completion of their services, all customer information is returned to American or destroyed. If we sell a business unit to another company and your personal data is used by that business unit, then your data may be transferred to the buyer along with the business for them to use in the same way. Return to Top The EU Data Privacy Directive The EU Data Privacy Directive gives you certain rights in relation to the information which we hold about you including a right to request a copy of the information.

 	// Apple Privacy Policy, http://www.apple.com/privacy/, retrieved 07/11/2013
	sessionStorage.setItem("TRAIND", "Your privacy is important to Apple. So we’ve developed a Privacy Policy that covers how we collect, use, disclose, transfer, and store your information. Please take a moment to familiarize yourself with our privacy practices and let us know if you have any questions. Collection and Use of Personal Information Personal information is data that can be used to uniquely identify or contact a single person. You may be asked to provide your personal information anytime you are in contact with Apple or an Apple affiliated company. Apple and its affiliates may share this personal information with each other and use it consistent with this Privacy Policy. They may also combine it with other information to provide and improve our products, services, content, and advertising. Here are some examples of the types of personal information Apple may collect and how we may use it. What personal information we collect When you create an Apple ID, register your products, apply for commercial credit, purchase a product, download a software update, register for a class at an Apple Retail Store, or participate in an online survey, we may collect a variety of information, including your name, mailing address, phone number, email address, contact preferences, and credit card information. When you share your content with family and friends using Apple products, send gift certificates and products, or invite others to join you on Apple forums, Apple may collect the information you provide about those people such as name, mailing address, email address, and phone number. In the U.S., we may ask for your Social Security number (SSN) but only in limited circumstances such as when setting up a wireless account and activating your iPhone or when determining whether to extend commercial credit. How we use your personal information The personal information we collect allows us to keep you posted on Apple’s latest product announcements, software updates, and upcoming events. It also helps us to improve our services, content, and advertising. If you don’t want to be on our mailing list, you can opt out anytime by updating your preferences. We also use personal information to help us develop, deliver, and improve our products, services, content, and advertising. From time to time, we may use your personal information to send important notices, such as communications about purchases and changes to our terms, conditions, and policies. Because this information is important to your interaction with Apple, you may not opt out of receiving these communications. We may also use personal information for internal purposes such as auditing, data analysis, and research to improve Apple’s products, services, and customer communications. If you enter into a sweepstake, contest, or similar promotion we may use the information you provide to administer those programs. Collection and Use of Non-Personal Information We also collect non-personal information - data in a form that does not permit direct association with any specific individual. We may collect, use, transfer, and disclose non-personal information for any purpose. The following are some examples of non-personal information that we collect and how we may use it: We may collect information such as occupation, language, zip code, area code, unique device identifier, location, and the time zone where an Apple product is used so that we can better understand customer behavior and improve our products, services, and advertising. We also may collect information regarding customer activities on our website, iCloud and MobileMe services, and iTunes Store and from our other products and services. This information is aggregated and used to help us provide more useful information to our customers and to understand which parts of our website, products, and services are of most interest. Aggregated data is considered non-personal information for the purposes of this Privacy Policy. If we do combine non-personal information with personal information the combined information will be treated as personal information for as long as it remains combined. Cookies and Other Technologies Apple’s website, online services, interactive applications, email messages, and advertisements may use “cookies” and other technologies such as pixel tags and web beacons. These technologies help us better understand user behavior, tell us which parts of our website people have visited, and facilitate and measure the effectiveness of advertisements and web searches. We treat information collected by cookies and other technologies as non-personal information. However, to the extent that Internet Protocol (IP) addresses or similar identifiers are considered personal information by local law, we also treat these identifiers as personal information. Similarly, to the extent that non-personal information is combined with personal information, we treat the combined information as personal information for the purposes of this Privacy Policy. Apple and its partners use cookies and other technologies in mobile advertising services to control the number of times you see a given ad, deliver ads that relate to your interests, and measure the effectiveness of ad campaigns. If you do not want to receive ads with this level of relevance on your mobile device, you can opt out by accessing the following link on your device: http://oo.apple.com. If you opt out, you will continue to receive the same number of mobile ads, but they may be less relevant because they will not be based on your interests. You may still see ads related to the content on a web page or in an application or based on other non-personal information. This opt-out applies only to Apple advertising services and does not affect interest-based advertising from other advertising networks. Apple and our partners also use cookies and other technologies to remember personal information when you use our website, online services, and applications. Our goal in these cases is to make your experience with Apple more convenient and personal. For example, knowing your first name lets us welcome you the next time you visit the Apple Online Store. Knowing your country and language - and if you are an educator, your school - helps us provide a customized and more useful shopping experience. Knowing someone using your computer or device has shopped for a certain product or used a particular service helps us make our advertising and email communications more relevant to your interests. And knowing your contact information, product serial numbers, and information about your computer or device helps us register your products, personalize your operating system, set up your iCloud service, and provide you with better customer service. If you want to disable cookies and you’re using the Safari web browser, go to Safari preferences and then to the privacy pane to disable cookies. On your Apple mobile device, go to Settings, then Safari, and then to the Cookies section. For other browsers, check with your provider to find out how to disable cookies. Please note that certain features of the Apple website will not be available once cookies are disabled. As is true of most websites, we gather some information automatically and store it in log files. This information includes Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, browser type and language, Internet service provider (ISP), referring and exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data. We use this information to understand and analyze trends, to administer the site, to learn about user behavior on the site, and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. Apple may use this information in our marketing and advertising services. In some of our email messages, we use a “click-through URL” linked to content on the Apple website. When customers click one of these URLs, they pass through a separate web server before arriving at the destination page on our website. We track this click-through data to help us determine interest in particular topics and measure the effectiveness of our customer communications. If you prefer not to be tracked in this way, you should not click text or graphic links in the email messages. Pixel tags enable us to send email messages in a format customers can read, and they tell us whether mail has been opened. We may use this information to reduce or eliminate messages sent to customers.  Disclosure to Third Parties At times Apple may make certain personal information available to strategic partners that work with Apple to provide products and services, or that help Apple market to customers. For example, when you purchase and activate your iPhone, you authorize Apple and its carrier to exchange the information you provide during the activation process to carry out service. If you are approved for service, your account will be governed by Apple and its carrier’s respective privacy policies. Personal information will only be shared by Apple to provide or improve our products, services and advertising; it will not be shared with third parties for their marketing purposes. Service Providers Apple shares personal information with companies who provide services such as information processing, extending credit, fulfilling customer orders, delivering products to you, managing and enhancing customer data, providing customer service, assessing your interest in our products and services, and conducting customer research or satisfaction surveys. These companies are obligated to protect your information and may be located wherever Apple operates. Others It may be necessary - by law, legal process, litigation, and/or requests from public and governmental authorities within or outside your country of residence - for Apple to disclose your personal information. We may also disclose information about you if we determine that for purposes of national security, law enforcement, or other issues of public importance, disclosure is necessary or appropriate. We may also disclose information about you if we determine that disclosure is reasonably necessary to enforce our terms and conditions or protect our operations or users. Additionally, in the event of a reorganization, merger, or sale we may transfer any and all personal information we collect to the relevant third party. Protection of Personal Information Apple takes precautions — including administrative, technical, and physical measures — to safeguard your personal information against loss, theft, and misuse, as well as against unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction. Apple online services such as the Apple Online Store and iTunes Store use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption on all web pages where personal information is collected. To make purchases from these services, you must use an SSL-enabled browser such as Safari, Firefox, or Internet Explorer. Doing so protects the confidentiality of your personal information while it’s transmitted over the Internet. When you use some Apple products, services, or applications or post on an Apple forum, chat room, or social networking service, the personal information you share is visible to other users and can be read, collected, or used by them. You are responsible for the personal information you choose to submit in these instances. For example, if you list your name and email address in a forum posting, that information is public. Please take care when using these features. Integrity and Retention of Personal Information Apple makes it easy for you to keep your personal information accurate, complete, and up to date. We will retain your personal information for the period necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law. Access to Personal Information You can help ensure that your contact information and preferences are accurate, complete, and up to date by logging in to your account at https://appleid.apple.com/. For other personal information, we make good faith efforts to provide you with access so you can request that we correct the data if it is inaccurate or delete the data if Apple is not required to retain it by law or for legitimate business purposes. We may decline to process requests that are unreasonably repetitive, require disproportionate technical effort, jeopardize the privacy of others, are extremely impractical, or for which access is not otherwise required by local law. Access, correction, or deletion requests can be made through the regional Privacy Contact Form. Children We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If we learn that we have collected the personal information of a child under 13 we will take steps to delete the information as soon as possible. Location-Based Services To provide location-based services on Apple products, Apple and our partners and licensees may collect, use, and share precise location data, including the real-time geographic location of your Apple computer or device. This location data is collected anonymously in a form that does not personally identify you and is used by Apple and our partners and licensees to provide and improve location-based products and services. For example, we may share geographic location with application providers when you opt in to their location services. Some location-based services offered by Apple, such as the “Find My iPhone” feature, require your personal information for the feature to work. Third-Party Sites and Services Apple websites, products, applications, and services may contain links to third-party websites, products, and services. Our products and services may also use or offer products or services from third parties - for example, a third-party iPhone app. Information collected by third parties, which may include such things as location data or contact details, is governed by their privacy practices. We encourage you to learn about the privacy practices of those third parties. International Users Information you provide may be transferred or accessed by entities around the world as described in this Privacy Policy. Apple abides by the “safe harbor” frameworks set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information collected by organizations in the European Economic Area and Switzerland. Learn more about the U.S. Department of Commerce Safe Harbor Program. Please note that personal information regarding individuals who reside in a member state of the European Economic Area (EEA) is controlled by Apple Distribution International in Cork, Ireland, and processed on its behalf by Apple Inc. Personal information collected in the EEA when using iTunes is controlled by iTunes SARL in Luxembourg and processed on its behalf by Apple Inc. Our Companywide Commitment to Your Privacy To make sure your personal information is secure, we communicate our privacy and security guidelines to Apple employees and strictly enforce privacy safeguards within the company. Privacy Questions If you have any questions or concerns about Apple’s Privacy Policy or data processing, please contact us. Apple may update its Privacy Policy from time to time. When we change the policy in a material way, a notice will be posted on our website along with the updated Privacy Policy. Apple Inc. 1 Infinite Loop, Cupertino, California, USA, 95014 Last updated: May 21, 2012 Apple Inc. has been awarded TRUSTe’s Privacy Seal signifying that this Privacy Policy and practices have been reviewed by TRUSTe for compliance with TRUSTe’s program requirements including transparency, accountability, and choice regarding the collection and use of your personal information.

Additional Information Advertising Bank of America advertises on pages within the Sites (including mobile downloadable apps) as well as on other websites and mobile apps not affiliated with Bank of America. Information collected by us or our advertising service providers through cookies and other technologies includes the number of people who look at each of the pages on the Sites, search engine referrals, browsing patterns within the Sites, and responses to advertisements and promotions on the Sites and on websites where we advertise. Advertising on our Sites Bank of America advertises our products and services, including prescreened offers of credit, on pages within the Sites. These advertisements may take the form of banner ads, splash ads (ads that appear as you sign on or sign off of your online accounts), and other formats.       Relationship based advertising       Bank of America may customize content and advertisements for our products and services       on the Sites we own. In order to make the content and advertising as informative and useful as       possible, we may use information about your relationship with us (such as types of accounts,       transactional information or the state in which you bank).       Online Behavioral Advertising       We also use advertising service providers to help us determine which of our advertisements       are most likely to be of interest to you using certain Other Information such as web pages       visited, search keywords entered, or your activities on our Site. We limit access and collection of       information for specific purposes by advertising service providers. If you prefer we not use relationship based and/or certain Other Information to provide customized content and advertising you may opt out of relationship based or online behavioral advertising on our Sites. Please note that if you opt out of either relationship based or online behavioral advertising on our Sites, you may still receive generic online advertising from Bank of America.  When you access account servicing areas (i.e. after sign-in), such as Online Banking or MyMerrill, you may see customized content and advertising based on your account relationships.  Opting out means that the content and advertising you receive on our non-servicing sites (i.e. before sign-in) will be generic and will not be based on your relationship, preferences or behavior.  See Important Reminder section below. Advertising on third party sites Bank of America contracts with advertising companies to advertise our products and services on websites and mobile apps not affiliated with us.  We may use Aggregated and De-identified Data and information provided by you to these third party websites to select which of our advertisements or offers may appeal to you, display them to you and monitor your responses.  Third Party websites are not subject to Bank of America Privacy Notices. Please visit the individual websites for additional information on their data and privacy practices and opt-out policies.       Online Behavioral Advertising       Some of our customized ads are behavioral advertising, and may be served using data collected       through cookies and other technologies by third party websites. Cookies placed on our behalf       by these companies, do not contain or capture Personal Information. We limit companies that       place our ads from using information for any purpose other than to assist us in our advertising       efforts.                Bank of America has adopted the use of the Advertising Options Icon on our behavioral                ads (excluding ads appearing on platforms that do not accept the icon). Anyone receiving                a behavioral ad may click on the displayed icon to receive more information and can                opt-out at that time or by visiting the third party website's privacy policy for an opt-out                mechanism, if any.                You may also opt-out of receiving behavioral ads from many websites through the                Network Advertising Initiative's Opt-Out Tool or other tools provided by the publishing                platform. Please note that if you opt-out, you may still receive generic online advertising from Bank of America. Opting out from a specific third party website means that the ads you receive will not be based on your preferences or behavior. Important Reminder In order for relationship based or behavioral advertising opt-outs from our Sites and other sites to work on your device, your browser must be set to accept cookies. If you delete cookies, buy a new device, access our Site or other sites from a different device, login under a different screen name, or change web browsers, you will need to opt-out again. If your browser has scripting disabled, you do not need to opt- out, as relationship based or online behavioral advertising technology does not work when scripting is disabled. Please check your browser's security settings to validate whether scripting is active or disabled.

We are not responsible for the use or disclosure of any Personal Information accessed by any company or person to whom you provide your Site username and password. If you provide your Site username, password or other information about your accounts with us to an aggregation website, we will consider that you have authorized all transactions or actions initiated by an aggregation website using access information you provide, whether or not you were aware of a specific transaction or action.

 	// BBC Privacy Policy, http://www.bbc.com/privacy/information/policy/, retrieved 07/13/2013
	sessionStorage.setItem("TRAIND", "Privacy Policy Our policy in full 1. Introduction & General Terms ?The BBC is committed to protecting your and your family's personal information when you are using BBC services. We want our services to be safe and enjoyable environments for our audience. This Privacy Policy relates to our use of any personal information you provide to us via phone or text, by email, in letters or correspondence. It also relates to our use of any personal information you provide to us online, on mobile or on the Red Button service. In order to provide you with the full range of BBC services, we sometimes need to collect information about you. This Privacy Policy explains the following: what information the BBC may collect about you; how the BBC will use information we collect about you; when the BBC may use your details to contact you; whether the BBC will disclose your details to anyone else; your choices regarding the personal information you provide to us; the use of cookies on BBC websites and how you can reject these cookies. The BBC is committed to safeguarding your personal information. Whenever you provide such information, we are legally obliged to use your information in line with all laws concerning the protection of personal information, including the Data Protection Act 1998 (these laws are referred to collectively in this Privacy Policy as the pdata protection lawsp). BBC websites contain hyperlinks to websites owned and operated by third parties. These third party websites have their own privacy policies, and are also likely to use cookies, and we therefore urge you to review them. They will govern the use of personal information you submit, which may also be collected by cookies whilst visiting these websites. We do not accept any responsibility or liability for the privacy practices of such third party websites and your use of such websites is at your own risk. 2. Who are we? ?The BBC is the largest broadcasting organisation in the world. We are a public service broadcaster, established by a Royal Charter and primarily funded by the licence fee that is paid by UK households. The BBC includes the BBC World Service, which broadcasts to the world on radio, on TV and online, providing news and information in 32 languages. It is funded by a government grant, not from the licence fee. The BBC also has a commercial arm, BBC Worldwide Limited and its group companies (“BBC Worldwide”). BBC Worldwide is a wholly owned subsidiary and returns its profits to the BBC for investment in new programming and services. Amongst other activities, BBC Worldwide operates the international, advertising-funded version of the BBC website, bbc.com, for users from outside of the UK. BBC Worldwide’s activities are only covered by this Privacy Policy in relation to its use of any personal information collected on bbc.com. To find out more about BBC Worldwide, its commercial operations and how it will use personal information collected when you use its other international and UK services, please see its corporate website and the BBC Worldwide Privacy Policy. When we refer to ‘’we’’ or ‘’our’’ or ‘’the BBC’’ we are referring to the BBC, the BBC World Service and BBC Worldwide (but only in relation to BBC Worldwide’s use of information collected via bbc.com). 3. What information will the BBC collect about me? ?When you participate in, access or sign up to any of the BBC’s services, activities or online content, such as newsletters, competitions, live chats, message boards, telephone or text the BBC, vote, donate money to a BBC charity appeal, book tickets for a BBC event or create an account using the BBC’s online registration system we may receive personal information about you. This can consist of information such as your name, email address, postal address, telephone or mobile number or date of birth, depending on the activity. By submitting your details, you enable the BBC (and where applicable its contractors) to provide you with the services, activities or online content you select. Please note that sometimes we will require you to provide additional personal information, and sometimes sensitive personal information (e.g. if you're sending in an application to be a contributor on a political party we may need to know your political leanings). When we do this we will provide further information as to why we are collecting your information and how we will use it. The BBC also uses cookies (see section 13 below for details) and collects IP addresses (an IP address is a number that can uniquely identify a specific computer or other network device on the internet) from visitors to BBC websites. 4. How will the BBC use the information it collects about me? ?The BBC will use your personal information for a number of purposes including the following: to provide our services, activities or online content and to deal with your requests and enquiries; for pservice administration purposesp, which means that the BBC may contact you for reasons related to the service, activity or online content you have signed up for, as set out in section 5 below (e.g. to provide you with password reminders or to notify you that a particular service, activity or online content has been suspended for maintenance); to contact you about a submission you have made, including any content you provide. For additional information, please see the UGC FAQS (User Generated Content Frequently Asked Questions); to provide you with information about our services, activities or online content; to personalise the way BBC content is presented to you (e.g. if the first thing you look at every day on the BBC website is the weather for Luton, we may present this information or a link to it on your homepage); to use IP addresses to identify the location of users, to block disruptive use, to establish the number of visits from different countries and to determine whether you are accessing the services from the UK or not. If not, you will be re-directed to the international version of the BBC website (bbc.com), (see section 12 for details); to analyse and improve the services offered on BBC websites; to provide you with the most user-friendly navigation experience. The BBC may also use and disclose information in aggregate (so that no individuals are identified) for marketing and strategic development purposes; and when you access the BBC website from outside the UK, you will see the international version (bbc.com) which features advertising. A certain amount of this advertising is tailored to the individual user. BBC Worldwide uses cookies to work out what advertising might be most relevant to you based on the pages you look at on the international version of the BBC website and other BBC Worldwide sites, and your IP address information. This is a practice widely used by other major web publishers and is known as “onsite behavioural targeting”. The tracking system is anonymised and therefore it does not “know who you are”: it simply uses the limited information available to it to serve ads to you, if you are accessing the BBC website from outside the UK, which it believes are relevant. Find out more about BBC Worldwide’s use of its behavioural targeting system in the international users section of the BBC Privacy & Cookies website. It is important to remember that you will only see this advertising, and receive Behavioural Targeted Marketing cookies, if you are visiting bbc.com from outside the UK. Where the BBC proposes using your personal information for any other uses we will ensure that we notify you first. You will also be given the opportunity to withhold or withdraw your consent for the use of your personal information for purposes other than those listed above. 5. When will the BBC contact me? ?The BBC may contact you: in relation to any service, activity or online content you have signed up for in order to ensure that the BBC can deliver the services to you; in relation to any correspondence we receive from you or any comment or complaint you make about BBC products or services; in relation to any contribution you have submitted to the BBC, e.g. on the BBC message boards or via text or voicemail message; to invite you to participate in surveys about the BBC services (participation is always voluntary); and for marketing purposes, where you have agreed to this (see section 6 below) Local pages will give you detailed information about how the BBC will contact you in relation to specific services, activities or online content. 6. Will I be contacted for marketing purposes? ?The BBC will only use your information for marketing purposes, or to promote new services, activities or online content where you have agreed to this. 7. Will the BBC share my personal information with anyone else? ?We will keep your information confidential except where disclosure is required or permitted by law (for example to government bodies and law enforcement agencies) or as described in section 8 below. Generally, we will only use your information within the BBC. However, sometimes the BBC uses third parties to process your information on our behalf. The BBC requires these third parties to comply strictly with its instructions and the BBC requires that they do not use your personal information for their own business purposes, unless you have explicitly consented to the use of your personal information in this way. 8. Offensive or inappropriate content on BBC websites ?If you post or send offensive, inappropriate or objectionable content anywhere on or to BBC websites or otherwise engage in any disruptive behaviour on any BBC service, the BBC may use your personal information to stop such behaviour. Where the BBC reasonably believes that you are or may be in breach of any applicable laws (e.g. because content you have posted may be defamatory), the BBC may use your personal information to inform relevant third parties such as your employer, school email/internet provider or law enforcement agencies about the content and your behaviour. 9. What if I am a user aged 16 or under? ?If you are aged 16 or under, please get your parent/guardian's permission before you provide any personal information to the BBC. Users without this consent are not allowed to provide us with personal information. 10. How long will the BBC keep my personal information? ?We will hold your personal information on our systems for as long as is necessary for the relevant activity, or as long as is set out in any relevant contract you hold with the BBC or the BBC's corporate retention schedule (a database that defines which documents should be kept and for how long). If you cancel your registration as a BBC website member and your account is deleted a red flag goes on the database and, while the BBC cannot use the personal information, it stays on the system for a period of one year for administration purposes before being deleted automatically. Where you contribute material to the BBC we will generally only keep your content for as long as is reasonably required for the purpose(s) for which it was submitted. For example, we will only keep copies of entries to a photographic competition for the duration of the competition. However other projects (e.g. the People's War website) are likely to have a longer, or even permanent, duration. The BBC, as a publicly funded organisation, also has an obligation to record snapshots of history which may include some User Generated Content i.e. content provided by the public. Therefore, some content submitted to, or shared with, the BBC may be retained for prolonged periods of time or potentially indefinitely in the BBC's Archive, which is true of News contributions which are published. There may also be rare instances where we will share your contribution with third parties in the interests of maintaining historical archives (e.g. contributions about people's experiences in the Second World War were given to the Imperial War Museum). Where possible, we will endeavour to inform you upfront or let you know at a later date where we are likely to keep content indefinitely or pass it onto an approved historical archive. 11. Can I find out what personal information the BBC holds about me? ?Under the Data Protection Act you have the right to request a copy of the personal information the BBC holds about you and to have any inaccuracies corrected. (We charge £10 for information requests and require you to prove your identity with 2 pieces of approved identification). We will use reasonable efforts to supply, correct or delete personal information about you on our files. Please address requests and questions about this or any other question about this Privacy Policy to the Data Protection Officer, Room2252, White City Building, 201 Wood Lane, London W12 7TS (Email: dpa.officer@bbc.co.uk) 12. What if I am accessing BBC websites outside the UK? ?The BBC website is published in the UK by the BBC as bbc.co.uk. The international version of the website, bbc.com, is made available to international users accessing the website from outside the UK by the BBC's commercial subsidiary, BBC Worldwide Ltd, on a commercial basis (i.e. some of the pages you access from outside the UK will have advertising on them) under licence from the BBC. Please note that some pages of the BBC website are made available to users outside the UK on a non-commercial basis (for example, the front page for the BBC World Service’s foreign language sites, e.g. http://www.bbc.co.uk/mundo/index.shtml). All personal information submitted by users outside the UK to bbc.com and to the World Service’s foreign language sites will be processed in accordance with this Privacy Policy (and any local terms that apply to certain areas of the site). Where there is a conflict, the local terms will apply. 13. Cookies Policy - Information the BBC collects from you ?a. What is a cookie? A cookie is a small amount of data, which often includes a unique identifier that is sent to your computer, tablet or mobile phone (referred to here as a pdevicep) browser from a website's computer and is stored on your device's hard drive. Each website can send its own cookie to your browser if your browser's preferences allow it, but (to protect your privacy) your browser only permits a website to access the cookies it has already sent to you, not the cookies sent to you by other websites. Many websites do this whenever a user visits their website in order to track online traffic flows. On BBC websites, cookies record information about your online preferences and allow us to tailor our websites to your interests. During the course of any visit to a BBC website, the pages you see, along with a cookie, are downloaded to your device. Many websites do this, because cookies enable website publishers to do useful things like find out whether the device (and probably its user) has visited the website before. This is done on a repeat visit by checking to see, and finding, the cookie left there on the last visit. b. How does the BBC use cookies? Information supplied by cookies can help us to analyse the profile of our visitors and help us to provide you with a better user experience. For example, if on a previous visit you went to our education pages, we might find this out from your cookie and highlight educational information on your second and subsequent visits. The BBC uses this type of information to help improve the services it provides to its users. All third parties are strictly required not to use any information for their own business or other purposes (see section 6 above). Certain areas of BBC websites may use cookies for a specific reason - for example, to help an online game work effectively on your device.   Additionally, BBC Worldwide uses cookies to serve some targeted advertising on bbc.com to non-UK users. Further information, including how to opt-out of receiving these cookies, can be found in the international users section of the BBC Privacy & Cookies website. c. Third Party Cookies in embedded content on BBC pages Please note that during your visits to BBC websites you may notice some cookies that are not related to the BBC or the BBC’s contractors. When you visit a page with content embedded from, for example, YouTube or Flickr, you may be presented with cookies from these websites. The BBC does not control the dissemination of these cookies. You should check the third party websites for more information about these. Find out more about third party cookies in embedded content. d. BBC cookies and how to reject cookies? Full information about how the BBC uses cookies can be found in the cookies section of the BBC Privacy & Cookies website. If you wish to control what cookies are set on your device through the BBC website then you can find out how to do this in the Managing Cookies section of the BBC Privacy & Cookies website. It is important to note that if you change your settings and block certain cookies, this means that certain personalised features cannot then be provided and accordingly you may not be able to take full advantage of all of the websites' features. 14. Changes to BBC's Privacy Policy ?This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time so you may wish to check it each time you submit personal information to the BBC. The date of the most recent revisions will appear on this page. If you do not agree to these changes, please do not continue to use BBC websites to submit personal information to the BBC. If material changes are made to the Privacy Policy we will notify you by placing a prominent notice on the website. 15. Other BBC Operations e.g. TV Licensing ?Some areas, such as TV Licensing and BBC charity appeals have their own privacy and cookies policies which you should also read before submitting your personal information. Go to the TV Licensing Privacy Policy to see how the BBC uses your personal information for TV Licensing purposes. In relation to BBC Worldwide, this Privacy Policy only applies to its use of data collected via the international version of the BBC website, bbc.com, which is accessed by users from outside the UK. For details of how BBC Worldwide uses personal information collected via its other international and UK services please see BBC Worldwide’s Privacy Policy 16. Contacting the BBC about this Privacy Policy ?If you any questions or comments about this Privacy Policy please contact: The Data Protection Officer Room 2252 White City Building 201 Wood Lane London W12 7TS (Email: dpa.officer@bbc.co.uk) If you are viewing the international version of this website, bbc.com, and you have any questions or comments about the Privacy Policy, please contact BBC Worldwide via email: dataprotection@bbc.com Last updated: May 2012 1.

The Global Play feature requires that some or all of the personal information that you provided when you created your Battle.net account be transferred to servers operated by Blizzard in the regions where you wish to play. What are cookies and clear gifs and how are they used? Cookies are a feature of your Web browser that allows Web sites to transfer bits of information to your computer for record-keeping purposes. A cookie stored on your computer can be used to remember things like your password, or that you have already registered. This allows us to speed up your future activities, saving the time you would normally spend entering information such as your password or registration. In addition, Blizzard may use cookies to retrieve user information for promotional, marketing, or security purposes. Blizzard and our third-party tracking service also employ a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), that help us better manage content on our site by informing us what content is effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. These clear gifs are not tied to personally identifiable information. Our third-party tracking service uses cookies and clear gifs to track non-personally identifiable information about visitors to our site in the aggregate. They capture usage and volume statistics to help improve our Web site. We have no access or control of these third-party tracking utilities. We also use clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to let us know which emails have been opened by recipients. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns. For this reason, these types of clear gifs are tied to personally identifiable information. What are Internet protocol addresses? An Internet protocol (IP) address is the unique number assigned to your server or Internet Service Provider (ISP). Blizzard may track such IP addresses for system administration, to report aggregate information, site tracking, security purposes, or to prevent our servers from being abused. What do I do if I want to correct or delete my personal information? If for any reason you are concerned with the way we are using your personal information, or would like to correct or request that we delete such personal information, please contact Blizzard Entertainment Privacy Policy, Attention: Privacy Policy Administrator, at 16215 Alton Pkwy. Irvine CA 92618-3616. You can "
	+ "also contact us by e-mailing us at privacy@blizzard.com. We will respond to any request for access within 30 days. In some cases, we may not be able to delete your personal information and will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements. Please note that the deletion of your data will lead to the termination of your account and applicable services. How secure is my personal information? Blizzard has taken steps to assure that all information collected will remain secure and in its original form, i.e. free from any alteration. As such, access to all personal information is strictly controlled. When credit card information is transmitted, for example, we use industry standard, SSL (secure sockets layer) encryption. In addition, we will take reasonable steps to assure that third parties to whom we transfer any data will provide sufficient protection of personal information. We will retain your information for as long as needed to provide you services. What if I have a question or complaint? If you have any questions or wish to file a complaint, please feel free to e-mail us at privacy@blizzard.com or send a letter addressed to Blizzard Entertainment Privacy Policy, Attention: Privacy Policy Administrator, at 16215 Alton Pkwy.

Collection of Information by Third-Party Sites, Ad Servers, and Sponsors Some of our sites contain links to or integrations with other sites such as Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, etc., whose information practices may be different than ours. Visitors should consult the other sites' privacy notices as we have no control over information that is submitted to, or collected by, these third parties. Turner Network sites covered by this privacy statement may offer content (e.g., contests, sweepstakes, promotions, games, applications, or social network integrations) that is sponsored by or co-branded with identified third parties. By virtue of these relationships, the third parties may obtain personally identifiable information that visitors voluntarily submit to participate in the site activity. We have no control over these third parties' use of this information. The site will notify you at the time of requesting personally identifiable information if these third parties will obtain such information. We also use the services of reputable third parties to provide us with data collection, reporting, ad response measurement, and site analytics, as well as to assist with delivery of relevant marketing messages and advertisements. These third parties may view, edit or set their own cookies. We, our third party service providers, advertisers and/or partners may also place web beacons for these third parties.

Ad Choices Our goal at the Turner Network is to provide you with ads that are relevant to you. Advertising enables us to provide the rich content for which sites on the Turner Network are known. Often our ads are based on the content of pages you are viewing, but we also provide ads tailored to your interests. Our hope is that by presenting ads tailored to your interests, we will enhance your experience across the Turner Network's diverse websites. For example, if you often visit content on the Turner Network about travel, we may use web beacons to infer your possible interest in travel and may deliver an ad to you related to that interest. It's important to understand that these technologies do not use personally identifiable information to make this happen but instead use anonymous identifiers within the cookies stored in your browser. We offer you choices with regard to interest-based ads. To learn more about interest-based ads and the choices available to you, please visit our Ad Choices page.

Non-Personal Information includes information such as the web pages that you have viewed. In order to access certain features and benefits on our Site, you may need to submit Personally Identifiable Information (i.e., information that can be used to identify you). Personally Identifiable Information can include information such as your name and email address, among other things. You are responsible for ensuring the accuracy of the Personally Identifiable Information you submit to Coursera. Inaccurate information may affect your ability to use the Site, the information you receive when using the Site, and our ability to contact you.

We also collect information from the URLs from which you linked to our Site. Collecting such information may involve logging the IP address, operating system and browser software used by each user of the Site. Although such information is not Personally Identifiable Information, we may be able to determine from an IP address a user's Internet Service Provider and the geographic location of his or her point of connectivity. We also use or may use cookies and/or web beacons to help us determine and identify repeat visitors, the type of content and sites to which a user of our Site links, the length of time each user spends at any particular area of our Site, and the specific functionalities that users choose to use. Essentially, cookies are a user's identification card for the Coursera servers. Web beacons are small graphic files linked to our servers that allow us to track your use of our Site and related functionalities. Cookies and web beacons allow Coursera to serve you better and more efficiently, and to personalize your experience at our Site. Cookies and web beacons are not used to retain Personally Identifiable Information. From time to time we may also use additional typical methods of collecting data.

 	// Dropbox Privacy Policy, https://www.dropbox.com/privacy, retrieved 07/13/2013
	sessionStorage.setItem("TRAIND","Privacy Policy Last Modified: April 10, 2013 This Privacy Policy provides our policies and procedures for collecting, using, and disclosing your information. Users can access the Dropbox service (the “Service”) through our website www.dropbox.com, applications on Devices, through APIs, and through third-parties. A “Device” is any computer used to access the Dropbox Service, including without limitation a desktop, laptop, mobile phone, tablet, or other consumer electronic device. This Privacy Policy governs your access of the Dropbox Service, regardless of how you access it, and by using our Services you consent to the collection, transfer, processing, storage, disclosure and other uses described in this Privacy Policy. All of the different forms of data, content, and information described below are collectively referred to as “information.” 1. The Information We Collect And Store We may collect and store the following information when running the Dropbox Service: Information You Provide.   When you register an account, we collect some personal information, such as your name, phone number, credit card or other billing information, email address and home and business postal addresses. You may also ask us to import your contacts by giving us access to your third party services (for example, your email account) or to use your social networking information if you give us access to your account on social network connection services. When you invite others to join Dropbox by using our referral page, we send them a one-time email for that referral. You may also provide us with your contacts’ email addresses when sharing folders or files with them. We may also receive Personal Information (for example, your email address) through other users, for example if they have tried to share something with you or tried to refer Dropbox to you. Files.   We collect and store the files you upload, download, or access with the Dropbox Service (“Files”). If you add a file to your Dropbox that has been previously uploaded by you or another user, we may associate all or a portion of the previous file with your account rather than storing a duplicate. Log Data.   When you use the Service, we automatically record information from your Device, its software, and your activity using the Services. This may include the Device’s Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, browser type, the web page visited before you came to our website, information you search for on our website, locale preferences, identification numbers associated with your Devices, your mobile carrier, date and time stamps associated with transactions, system configuration information, metadata concerning your Files, and other interactions with the Service. Cookies.   We also use “cookies” to collect information and improve our Services. A cookie is a small data file that we transfer to your Device. We may use “persistent cookies” to save your registration ID and login password for future logins to the Service. We may use “session ID cookies” to enable certain features of the Service, to better understand how you interact with the Service and to monitor aggregate usage and web traffic routing on the Service. You can instruct your browser, by changing its options, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit. If you do not accept cookies, however, you may not be able to use all aspects of the Service. 2. How We Use Personal Information Personal Information.   In the course of using the Service, we may collect personal information that can be used to contact or identify you (“Personal Information”). Personal Information is or may be used: (i) to provide and improve our Service, (ii) to administer your use of the Service, (iii) to better understand your needs and interests, (iv) to personalize and improve your experience, and (v) to provide or offer software updates and product announcements. If you no longer wish to receive communications from us, please follow the “unsubscribe” instructions provided in any of those communications, or update your account settings information. Geo-Location Information.   Some Devices allow applications to access real-time location-based information (for example, GPS). Our mobile apps do not collect such information from your mobile device at any time while you download or use our mobile apps as of the date this policy went into effect, but may do so in the future with your consent to improve our Services. Some photos and videos you place in Dropbox may contain recorded location information. We may use this information to optimize your experience. If you do not wish to share files embedded with your geo-location information with us, please do not upload them. If you don’t want to store location data in your photos or videos, please consult the documentation for your camera to turn off that feature. Also, some of the information we collect from a Device, for example IP address, can sometimes be used to approximate a Device’s location. Analytics.   We also collect some information (ourselves or using third party services) using logging and cookies, such as IP address, which can sometimes be correlated with Personal Information. We use this information for the above purposes and to monitor and analyze use of the Service, for the Service’s technical administration, to increase our Service’s functionality and user-friendliness, and to verify users have the authorization needed for the Service to process their requests. As of the date this policy went into effect, we use Google Analytics. To learn more about the privacy policy of Google Analytics, click here, and to learn how to opt out of that service click here. 3. Information Sharing and Disclosure Your Use.   We will display your Personal Information in your profile page and elsewhere on the Service according to the preferences you set in your account. Any information you choose to provide should reflect how much you want others to know about you. Please consider carefully what information you disclose in your profile page and your desired level of anonymity. You can review and revise your profile information at any time. We do not sell your personal information to third parties. We may also share or disclose your information with your consent, for example if you use a third party application to access your account (see below). Through certain features of the Service, you may also have the ability to make some of your information public. Public information may be broadly and quickly disseminated. Service Providers, Business Partners and Others.   We may use certain trusted third party companies and individuals to help us provide, analyze, and improve the Service (including but not limited to data storage, maintenance services, database management, web analytics, payment processing, and improvement of the Service’s features). These third parties may have access to your information only for purposes of performing these tasks on our behalf and under obligations similar to those in this Privacy Policy. As of the date this policy went into effect, we use Amazon’s S3 storage service to store some of your information (for example, your Files). You can find more information on Amazon's data security from the S3 site or, read more about how Dropbox and Amazon securely store data. Third-Party Applications.   We may share your information with a third party application with your consent, for example when you choose to access our Services through such an application. We are not responsible for what those parties do with your information, so you should make sure you trust the application and that it has a privacy policy acceptable to you. Compliance with Laws and Law Enforcement Requests; Protection of Dropbox's Rights.   We may disclose to parties outside Dropbox files stored in your Dropbox and information about you that we collect when we have a good faith belief that disclosure is reasonably necessary to (a) comply with a law, regulation or compulsory legal request; (b) protect the safety of any person from death or serious bodily injury; (c) prevent fraud or abuse of Dropbox or its users; or (d) to protect Dropbox’s property rights. If we provide your Dropbox files to a law enforcement agency as set forth above, we will remove Dropbox’s encryption from the files before providing them to law enforcement. However, Dropbox will not be able to decrypt any files that you encrypted prior to storing them on Dropbox. Business Transfers.   If we are involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of our assets, your information may be transferred as part of that transaction, but we will notify you (for example, via email and/or a prominent notice on our website) of any change in control or use of your Personal Information or Files, or if either become subject to a different Privacy Policy. We will also notify you of choices you may have regarding the information. Non-private or Non-Personal Information.   We may disclose your non-private, aggregated, or otherwise non-personal information, such as usage statistics of our Service. 4. Changing or Deleting Your Information If you are a registered user, you may review, update, correct or delete the Personal Information provided in your registration or account profile by changing your “account settings.” If your personally identifiable information changes, or if you no longer desire our service, you may update or delete it by making the change on your account settings. In some cases we may retain copies of your information if required by law. For questions about your Personal Information on our Service, please contact privacy@dropbox.com. We will respond to your inquiry within 30 days. 5. Data Retention We will retain your information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you services.

We may retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements. Consistent with these requirements, we will try to delete your information quickly upon request. Please note, however, that there might be latency in deleting information from our servers and backed-up versions might exist after deletion. In addition, we do not delete from our servers files that you have in common with other users. 6. Dropbox for Business Users If you have a Dropbox for Business account, your Administrator may be able to: access information in and about your Dropbox for Business account; disclose, restrict, or access information that you have provided or that is made available to you when using your Dropbox for Business account; and control how your Dropbox for Business account may be accessed or deleted.

We follow generally accepted standards to protect the information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of electronic transmission or storage is 100% secure, however. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

Information Automatically Collected We automatically receive and collect certain types of information whenever you visit our websites. For example, like many other websites, we use cookies and web beacons (described below) and obtain certain types of information when your browser accesses our websites. This information includes the Internet protocol (IP) address of your computer, your geographic location as determined by your IP address, your browser software and operating system, your web server, the date and time you access our site, session information (such as download errors and page response times), information about your viewing, search and purchase history, and information about the referring URL and the URL clickstream to, through, and from our websites. We use this information to monitor the usage and performance of our site, to enhance our customers' search and shopping experiences and to determine aggregate information about our user base and usage patterns. If you would like more information about these practices or to learn about your options for not having this information used, please visit http://www.aboutads.info. Information From Third Parties If we receive updated account information from third parties, we may revise your account for you so that we can efficiently process your orders, deliver your packages, or otherwise communicate with you. For example, we may receive customer information from our shippers or from third parties with which we operate co-branded businesses. In addition, we may acquire customer names, e-mail addresses, and mailing addresses for select mailings from third parties. Other Information You Provide We collect additional information that you choose to give us. For example, you provide information to us when you complete surveys or sweepstakes/contest entry forms, add items to Your List™, sign up for special discounts or coupons, communicate with us by e-mail, phone or otherwise, provide product reviews, or provide alternative delivery addresses. Sharing Your Information with Third Parties We protect all of your information against unauthorized access or release. We share your personal and prescription information with third parties as follows: GNC - Because we sell and accept GNC Gold Cards on behalf of GNC, when you purchase a GNC Gold Card from the drugstore.com™ website, we share your name, address, phone number, gender, and birth month and year with GNC. At your direction, we also share your e-mail address. When you use your GNC Gold Card to purchase GNC products at the drugstore.com™ website, we share with GNC a list of the products you purchased in the GNC Live Well store. We do not share with GNC information about products that you purchase outside of the GNC Live Well store. Pharmacy service provided through the drugstore.com website is provided by Walgreen Co. Information you provide to Walgreens is governed by Walgreens privacy policies and practices. Flexible Spending Account (FSA) Purchases – When you make a purchase from the drugstore.com™ website of FSA-reimbursable items that will be automatically deducted from your FSA account (i.e., if you use your FSA-approved credit or debit card to make the purchase or if we have an arrangement with your FSA administrator to provide electronic substantiation on your behalf), we share with your FSA administrator a list of the FSA-eligible products you purchased, together with such account, transaction, and payment information as may be requested by your FSA administrator for the purpose of substantiating and tracking your purchase. We do not share with your FSA administrator information about non-FSA items you purchase. Brand Manufacturers - We may develop programs with some of our brand manufacturers through which you may be offered special discounts or coupons on products in exchange for providing your e-mail address or completing a survey about the manufacturer's products. When you are offered such discounts or coupons in exchange for providing information (for example, giving your e-mail address or completing a survey), you will be notified that if you choose to participate, your name, e-mail address and responses will be shared with the brand manufacturer. We will share no other information. Brand Partnerships - We may partner with outside brands or vendors to fulfill orders placed through their websites. We may share your name and e-mail address with these outside vendors or brands that refer you to drugstore.com to complete your order. Business Transfers - We may buy or sell stores or assets. In such transactions, customer information is usually treated as one of the transferred business assets. Should drugstore.com, inc., or substantially all of its assets be sold, customer information will be one of the transferred business assets. In that event, we will post a notification on this page or send you an e-mail so that you are always aware of how we are using your information. Compliance with Law; Protection of Rights, Property, or Safety - We reserve the right to disclose your personally identifiable information as required by law and when we believe disclosure is necessary to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, and/or legal process served on us; and/or to protect our rights and the rights of our customers; or to enforce or apply our Terms of Use or other policies or user agreements. As You Direct - If you direct us to, we will release other personally identifiable information to your authorized representative, specified marketing partners, or such other person as you may direct. At the direction of the customer and to the extent specifically authorized by law, we will release such information to other persons, including specified marketing partners. From time to time, we may partner with certain companies who, in conjunction with membership programs, subscription services, or rewards programs, require that we disclose purchase or other personal information about their members who visit our website (for example, to earn points for purchases made on our site through links from the partner site). We will disclose only the information required to make these programs work for you and support your membership in them. In addition, we disclose this information to such companies only if you have consented first, including consent implied by your agreement to the membership or participation rules. If you do not want us to disclose that information to the strategic partner, then you must contact the partner directly. Third Party Partners We may enter into agreements and may share your personal information with other companies or individuals to perform functions on our behalf. These functions may include analyzing data; providing marketing assistance; processing credit card or debit card payments; fulfilling and delivering orders and providing customer service. Additionally, third party providers send promotional e-mails on our behalf to such companies' customers or present advertisements on our behalf, a function called “behavioral targeted advertising.” These providers may use cookies, web beacons, or similar technologies (i) to present advertisements tailored to interests you have shown while browsing, (ii) to determine whether you have seen a particular advertisement before so as to avoid sending you duplicate advertisements, and (iii) to understand the patterns of people who see advertisements. In doing so, the provider collects non-personal data such as your browser type, operating system, websites you have visited, the time of the visits, the content you viewed, ads you viewed, and similar information. The provider may connect information about your visit on our website with information about your visit on other sites and tailor your advertisements based on this combined information. The companies and individuals with which we work have access only to information necessary to perform their functions. They are not allowed to use the information for any other purpose and are contractually obligated to maintain the confidentiality and security of the information. We may share non-personal, summary, or aggregate customer data with partners and other third parties. Some third party providers may not be bound by this privacy policy. Their use of third party cookies, web beacons, and similar technologies by these ad network providers may be governed by their own policy. If you wish to not have your personal information used to deliver targeted personalized advertising, you may opt-out of some companies personalized advertising services by visiting http://www.aboutads.info/choices/ or http://preferences-mgr.truste.com/. Other than as set out above, you will receive notice when information about you might go to third parties, and you will have an opportunity to choose not to share the information. Security When you place an order online, your personal information and credit card or debit card information are encrypted using SSL encryption technology before being sent over the Internet. We use SSL technology to prevent your information from being stolen or intercepted while being transferred to us and once we have received it. Your credit card information is always stored in encrypted form in a restricted-access database that is away from our website database so it is not connected to the Internet, to keep it safe from hackers. However, no method of transmission over the Internet, or electronic storage is 100% secure. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. Questions about the security of our website should be directed to privacy@drugstore.com. Cookies To personalize and enhance your browsing and shopping experience, we use a feature of your Internet browser called a cookie. Cookies are small files that your browser places on your computer's hard drive. Although we do not store personal information in cookies, we do tie cookies to a customer member ID which is then used to pull personal information out of the database for identification purposes. Cookies also let us know how you found us (e.g., through a particular website or advertisement). Cookies are not used to access information entered on the secure server. This information can be accessed only when you enter your name and password. If you choose to configure your browser to remove or reject our cookies, you will not be able to make purchases from our websites or take advantage of many of our features, such as Your List™. Web Beacons From time to time we contract with third party companies to help us better provide relevant products, services and information to you and to help us effectively measure advertising effectiveness. Some of these companies use cookies and/or web beacons (also known as action tags or single pixel gifs). A web beacon is a transparent image that has been placed on a web page and sends a signal when a user has visited that page. A web beacon does not contain any personal information. No information that is personally identifiable to you is transmitted to the third party using the web beacon. The third party is required to protect the privacy of the information it receives using web beacons or cookies and is not allowed to use the information it receives for any purpose beyond what is necessary to assist us. In addition, we may use web beacons in connection with the e-mails we send to our customers, to determine whether and when the images in our e-mail were rendered (which allows us to determine whether the e-mail was opened). This information may then be aggregated and used to assess the effectiveness of our e-mail communications. Unsolicited E-mail (SPAM) Your privacy is very important to us. Be assured that, in accordance with this privacy policy, we do not sell or distribute our customer list to third parties. You should be aware, however, that unscrupulous marketers can sometimes harvest your e-mail address directly from your computer or another person's address book or even obtain your e-mail address through programs that automatically search web pages and e-mail traffic for e-mail addresses. If you opt out of receiving e-mail advertisements from drugstore.com, we may share that information with third parties in order to instruct them not to send advertisements on our behalf to you. If drugstore.com shares opt out information with a third party, we will direct such third party to use this information solely to eliminate potential recipients from any e-mails they send out on our behalf. Please note that all e-mail that originates from us will either display the drugstore.com™ or Beauty.com™ logo (HTML e-mails) or contain our copyright notice (text e-mails). In addition, our e-mails will contain our corporate address in Bellevue, Washington. If you receive an unsolicited e-mail that you believe is connected with us in any way, please forward the e-mail (as an enclosure) to abuse@drugstore.com and we will investigate. Children We do not sell products for purchase by children. We sell children's products for purchase by adults. If you are under 18, you may use our website only with the involvement of a parent or guardian. Linked Web Sites Our websites may contain links to and from other sites operated and maintained by separate companies. We have no responsibility for linked websites (including the websites of participants in our associate program) and provide these links solely for the convenience of and to provide information to our visitors. The privacy policies of these sites may differ from our policy, so you should always review the privacy statement of each linked website you visit. Tell-A-Friend If you choose to use our referral service to tell a friend about our site, we will ask you for your friend’s name and e-mail address. We will automatically send your friend a one-time e-mail inviting him or her to visit the site. We do not store this information. Social Media (Features) and Widgets Our website includes Social Media Features, such as the Facebook Like button or interactive mini-programs that run on our site. These Features may collect your IP address, and the page addresses you visit on our site, and may use a cookie to enable the Features to function properly.

Your interactions with these Features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing them.

EA may also receive information from third parties in connection with market and demographic studies and/or other data that we use to supplement personal information provided directly by you. VI.    What Happens To The Information EA Collects? A. How EA Uses Your Information EA uses your information to fulfill your specific requests, purchase orders and to send you purchase confirmation and other account-related information. In addition, the personal information you provide will allow us to send you messages about things including new products, features, enhancements, special offers, upgrade opportunities, contests and events of interest. You may also later opt out of such communications sent via email. Otherwise, EA uses personal and non-personal information, both individually and combined together, to better enhance your user experience, improve our products and services, understand the behavior and preferences of our customers, to troubleshoot technical problems, to serve advertising, for authentication purposes, to enforce our Terms of Service, to ensure proper functioning of our products and services as well as to help improve them. In addition, we combine non-personal information with personal information, such as an email address, for purposes including providing excellent customer service, administering loyalty programs and tailoring our communications, offerings, web pages or game play experience to you. By use of friend finder tools such as Facebook, Game Center or other third party services in our online and mobile products and services, you acknowledge that use of these friend finder tools will help you find your contacts and will also allow your contacts to associate your Origin Account (and related gaming entitlements, including games played on PC, mobile and console platforms) with your social networking profile and/or email address. Your resulting friends' list, which may be accessible across EA social platforms as available, will be subject to this privacy policy.  Note that the friends that you choose to include on any EA or Origin friends' list may be able to find and/or identify you in the context of different EA products and services, and see the profiles you have established. Those friends may also be able to see the gamertags that you use across EA's suite of products and services.  Choose your friends carefully. If you choose to use our referral service to Tell a Friend about an EA product or site, we will ask you for your friend's name and email address. We will send your friend an email on your behalf inviting him or her to visit the site or check out our product. EA stores your friend's name and email for a short period for the sole purpose of sending this email and for redundancy checking, to be sure that your friend does not receive multiple copies of the same email message. We do not keep or use this information for any other purpose. Your participation in tournaments or other online game events is also conditional upon our collection, use, storage, transmission and public display of statistical data (such as your scores, rankings and achievements) generated through your participation. B. Will EA Share My Information With Third Parties? EA will never share your personally identifiable information with third parties without your consent.   We may, however, share non-personally identifiable, aggregated and/or public information with third parties.  There may be circumstances where you may share information on your own.  Please see section XI for more details about your rights to information you share publicly on EA including user generated content, forums, blogs, and profiles. You may also opt in to allow EA to share your personal information with companies and organizations that provide products or services that we believe may be of interest to you. To opt out of further communications from a marketing partner or sponsor with whom your information has been shared, please contact that partner or sponsor directly. EA does not disclose any personal information about children under 18 years of age who have registered on any of our websites to third parties, or share or disclose personal information other than as set forth in this policy, provided however, that in the event of a merger, acquisition, or the unlikely event of bankruptcy, management of EA customer information may be transferred to its successor or assign regardless of age. From time to time, EA employs third party contractors to collect personal information on our behalf to provide email delivery, product, prize or promotional fulfillment, contest administration, credit card processing, shipping or other services on our sites. When requesting these services, you may be asked to supply your name, mailing address, telephone number and email address to our contractors. We ask some third party contractors, such as credit agencies, data analytics or market research firms, to supplement personal information that you provide to us for our own marketing and demographic studies, so that we can consistently improve our sites and related advertising to better meet our visitors' needs and preferences. To enrich our understanding of individual customers, we tie this information to the personal information you provide to us. When our third party agents or service providers collect and/or have access any information other than non-personal, anonymous and/or aggregated data, EA requires that they use data consistently with our stated privacy policy. These third parties are prohibited from using your personal information for any other purpose without your specific consent. You will be notified before your personal information is collected by any third party that is not our agent/service provider, so you can make an informed choice as to whether or not to share your information with that party. We may also access and disclose personal information, including personal communications, in connection with report abuse functions in our products and services, to enforce legal rights and comply with the law, or to comply with an order from a government entity or other competent authority, or when we have reason to believe that a disclosure is necessary to address potential or actual injury or interference with our rights, property, operations, users or others who may be harmed or may suffer loss or damage, or when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, combat fraud and/or comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on EA. Note that certain publically available information you post and communicate on our and third party sites and services is public information for which you have no expectation of privacy.  See Section XI for more details. VII.    Where Is The Information Held? EA is a global organization and the majority of the computer systems on which EA collects, stores, and uses the information it collects or receives are based in the United States and The Netherlands. We may also utilize data storage facilities located in Asia, Canada and/or the European Union. Your personal information may be transferred to, used, processed or held by EA in the United States and in other countries, including countries outside your country of residence both in and outside the European Union and Asia, and used for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy. VIII.    How Does EA Protect Your Personal Information? EA understands the importance of keeping your information safe and secure. EA will make commercially reasonable efforts to protect your personal information and ensure the security of our systems. When you enter sensitive financial information (such as a credit card number) on our order forms, we encrypt the transmission of that information using commercially reasonable methods. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. We cannot guarantee that your information will not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards. We cannot assume responsibility or liability for unauthorized access to our servers and systems. IX.    Review, Correction Of Your Information, Requesting Removal From Mailing Lists And Deactivating Your Account You can correct or update your account information at any time by logging on our site and navigating to My Account, and viewing your Basic Information or other account settings. Should you be unable to log in or wish to have your account(s) deactivated, contact the Privacy Policy Administrator in your country as listed on our site at privacyadmin.ea.com, or if your country is not listed, by contacting the Privacy Policy Administrator in the United States. We will be happy to review, update or remove information as appropriate. We may still retain your information in our files however, to resolve disputes, enforce our user agreement, and due to technical and legal requirements and constraints related to the security, integrity and operation of our websites. Some EA sites or services may collect personal information that is not accessible via our site. However, in such cases, you may be able to access that information through alternative means of access described by the service or by writing your local privacy policy administrator at privacyadmin.ea.com and you will be contacted within 30 days regarding your request. If you've granted EA access to your Facebook account information through an EA or Playfish application, you may request that EA delete your Facebook information by contacting the Privacy Policy Administrator listed at privacyadmin.ea.com and specifying the Facebook application used.  Note that as a result of deleting your data associated with an application on Facebook, you will no longer have access to that application. X.    A Special Note About Children Many EA online or mobile products and services are intended for general audiences and do not knowingly collect any personal information from children. When an EA online or mobile product or service does request age information, and users identify themselves as under 13, the product or service will either block such users from providing personal information, or we will ensure consent is obtained from parents for the collection, use and sharing of their children's personal information. At that time, we will provide a description of the information that the child may make publically available, how we will use the information and other practices. We will not knowingly ask children under the age of 13 to provide more information than is reasonably necessary to provide our services. Please note that if you grant consent for your child to use EA's online or mobile products and services, this may include such general audience communication services as email, instant messaging, and online groups, and your child will be able to communicate with, and disclose personal information to, other users of all ages. Parents can review, edit, request the deletion, or prevent further collection or use of their children's personal information or make inquiries regarding this policy by sending an email to privacy_policy@ea.com; writing to Privacy Policy Administrator, 209 Redwood Shores Parkway, Redwood City, CA 94065; or calling (650) 628-1393.  Alternatively, you may also contact the appropriate Privacy Policy Administrator for your country listed at privacyadmin.ea.com. If we change this privacy statement in a way that expands the collection, use or disclosure of children's personal information to which a parent has previously consented, the parent will be notified and we will be required to obtain the parent's additional consent. We encourage you to talk with your children about communicating with strangers and disclosing personal information online. You and your child should review our Online Safety web page for additional information about using the Internet safely. Information collected is secured in a manner consistent with this privacy policy (see Section VIII above). If we change how we handle your child's information, we will notify you in a manner consistent with this policy. Under no circumstances do we condition a child's participation in an activity—like contests—on the child's disclosure of more personal information than is reasonably necessary to participate in the activity. On certain sites, we may not permit children to participate at all regardless of consent. XI.    Public Information Including User Generated Content, Online Forums, Blogs And Profiles You may choose to disclose information about yourself in the course of contributing user generated content to EA sites or games or in our online chat rooms, blogs, message boards, user profiles for public view or in similar forums on our sites and/or on third party sites. Information that you disclose in any of these forums is unencrypted, public information, may be accessed or recorded by EA employees, and there is no expectation of privacy or confidentiality there.  You should be aware that any personally identifiable information you submit in the course of these public activities can be read, collected, or used by other users of these forums, and could be used to send you unsolicited messages. We are not responsible for the personally identifiable information you choose to make public in any of these forums. Note also that in the ordinary course of Internet activity, certain information may be sent from your browser to third parties such as advertising networks and analytics companies.  EA has no control over the information sent from your browser to those networks or other third parties and recommends that you ensure that your browser settings prevent the disclosure of information you would not like to share. If you post a video, image or photo on one of our sites for public view you should be aware that these may be viewed, collected, copied and/or used by other users without your consent. We are not responsible for the videos, images or photos that you choose to submit to EA's site. Please see our Terms of Service at terms.ea.com on this point and for other guidelines about posting content on our websites. XII.    Third Party Sites. Our website may contain "
	+ "advertising or services which link to other websites such as Twitter, Facebook and YouTube. The fact that we link to a website is not an endorsement, authorization or representation of our affiliation with that third party. If you click on a link to a third party site, including on an advertisement, you will leave the EA site you are visiting and go to the site you selected. Because we cannot control the activities of third parties, we cannot accept responsibility for any use of your personal information by such third parties, and we cannot guarantee that they will adhere to the same privacy and security practices as EA. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of any other service provider from whom you request services. If you visit a third party website that is linked to an EA site, you should consult that site's privacy policy before providing any personal information. XIII.    Products Offered In Partnership With Third Party(s) Members may register for other services from our site(s). Certain products and/or services available on our site are provided to you in partnership with third party(s) and may require you to disclose personally identifiable information in order to register for and access such products and/or services. Such products and/or services shall identify the third party partners at the point of registration. If you elect to register for such products and/or services your personally identifiable information will be transferred to such third party(s) and will be subject to the privacy policy and practices of such third party(s). We are not responsible for the privacy practices and policies of such third party(s) and, therefore, you should review the privacy practices and policies of such third party(s) prior to providing your personally identifiable information in connection with such products and/or services.

This statement, set forth below, is our privacy statement for the United States Web site. Also, set forth below is our Safe Harbor statement which concerns the transfer of personal data from the European Union to the United States. These privacy statements describe the practices we follow to respect the privacy of all visitors to this site. At Ernst & Young, we have focused on implementing fair information practices that are designed to protect your privacy.

Should you decide to apply for a position via our Web site, the application and resume you submit will be entered into an Ernst & Young proprietary database. Your Choice. Ernst & Young gives you choices regarding the collection and usage of your personally identifiable information.

The type of information collected in surveys will vary.   Thought Leadership Registration. Ernst & Young occasionally requires registration in exchange for Ernst & Young thought leadership: white papers, articles, studies, reports, survey analyses, booklets, etc. Personally identifiable information may be asked on registration forms; the type of information collected will vary.

Further, some of the information on the nomination form may be used for research, educational, or any other purpose, but will not divulge the personal identity of the nominee or the identity of the nominee's company to any person other than the sponsors, the judges, and their respective affiliates. Nominees must consent to this usage in order to participate in the nomination process.

Cookies. The Ernst & Young ey.com Web site and/or any of its governed sections may use cookies. A Cookie is technology that allows our site to store tokens of information (an 'identifier') in your browser used only by our site while you are on our site. Cookies are not used to determine the personal identity of anyone who is merely visiting ey.com. They help us track traffic patterns so that we know what areas of our site users like and don't like. Cookies have other uses as well. In the Thought Center Webcast section, they are used to provide entry for subscribers who have chosen the automatic log-on feature during registration. Cookies are also used to prevent online poll participants from voting more than once. If you do not want to receive a cookie from ey.com or the Thought Center Webcast section, you have the option of setting your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie, so that you may determine whether to accept it or not. However, please be aware that if you do turn off 'cookies' in your browser, you will not be able to fully experience the features of the Thought Center Webcast section—such as automatic log-on and other personalization features. Web Beacons. Ernst & Young occasionally advertises on third party Web sites. As part of our effort to track the success of our advertising campaigns, we may at times use a visitor identification technology such as web beacons, or action tags, which count visitors who have come to ey.com after being exposed to an Ernst & Young banner ad on a third party site. We do not use this technology to access your personally identifiable information; it is only used to compile aggregated statistics about visitors who come to ey.com and to gauge the effectiveness of our ads. Apps, QR Codes and other related technologies. When you scan a QR Code, the third party that we engage to provide our QR Codes (3GVision) may collect certain information from your mobile device (such as your mobile device identifier and IP address). 3GVision uses this information only on our behalf for the purpose of providing anonymised statistical reports to us about users of our website and services. Exceptional Enterprise Tool. The Exceptional Enterprise Tool is hosted on behalf of Ernst & Young with a third party vendor, 1&1 Internet Inc. 701 Lee Road, Suite 300, Chesterbrook, PA 19087. Your email address is only required should you choose to register. The information you provide via the tool(including your email address if registered), will generate a unique report for your organisation based on your responses provided. All reports will be aggregated, and the aggregated information will be used by Ernst & Young to generate metrics around the areas of expertise of organisations at different stages of the organisation's growth cycle. In addition, Ernst & Young will host and facilitate future client discussions based on the responses obtained via the tool. However, at no point in the process will individual organisations be identified. Social Media Platforms. You may wish to participate in the various blogs, forums, wikis and other social media platforms hosted by Ernst & Young (“Social Media Platforms)which we make available to you. The main aim of these Social Media Platforms is to facilitate and allow you to share content. Ernst & Young cannot be held responsible if you share personal information on Social Media Platforms that is subsequently used, misused or otherwise appropriated by another user. Ernst & Young may also provide links to other social media platforms maintained on separate servers by individuals or organizations over which Ernst & Young has no control. Ernst & Young makes no representations or warranties regarding the accuracy or any other aspect of the information located on such servers. A link to a third party’s website should not be construed as an endorsement by either Ernst & Young or that third party of the other or its products and services. Ernst & Young makes no representations or warranties regarding how user data is stored or used on third-party servers. We recommend reviewing the privacy policy of each third-party site linked from Our Site to determine their use of your personal data. Data Security/Integrity. Ernst & Young has technological and operational security functions in place to protect personally identifiable information from loss, misuse, alteration or destruction. The data you may provide via the United States Web site is shared only with authorized employees of Ernst & Young, and on a limited basis, with vendors who supply information management services, and third parties in association with events (see Event Registration and Entrepreneur of the Year® Nominations paragraphs above). Access to your information is limited by need, and those who have access to the data have agreed to maintain the confidentiality of such information. In addition, Ernst & Young may disclose personally identifiable information as may be required by subpoena, search warrant, or other legal process. Supplier Diversity Program. Ernst & Young identifies and works with small, minority- and women-owned businesses. Our procurement teams use a supplier diversity database when searching for qualified suppliers. Certified companies can register to join our database via our web site (ey.com/us/supplierdiversity). The type of information collected on the secure registration form is standard in the supplier diversity industry, and the required information on the form is necessary to become part of our database. This information enables Ernst & Young to make informed procurement decisions. The registration form and the supplier database are maintained by a third party, who has agreed in writing to provide an adequate level of privacy protection for all Ernst & Young registrant data. If you have already registered, and would like to view or update your information, please log on to the site (a Forgot Your Password? feature is available there). If you have questions about our supplier diversity policies, please email the supplier diversity group. Children.

Email Communications. We want to make it easy for you to take advantage of travel-related opportunities on our website.

For example, if you search for a flight to New York on our website and have saved your itinerary or otherwise not yet booked your travel, we may send you an email message reminding you about your saved travel itinerary or about a special airfare to New York. Similarly, if you receive an email from us about New York travel and demonstrate an interest in New York hotels by affirmatively clicking on a link about New York hotels in the email, you may receive an email about New York hotel offers or other destination information. We believe these email messages will provide you with useful information about travel-related special offers available through our site. Please note that you will have the opportunity to choose not to receive these email messages in any such email we send. Please review Your choices with respect to the collection and use of your information below. With whom we share your information This website may share your information with the following entities: Suppliers, such as hotel, airline, car rental, and activity providers, who fulfill your travel reservations.

We do not place limitations on our suppliers' use or disclosure of your other personal information. Therefore, we encourage you to review the privacy policies of any travel supplier whose products you purchase through this site. Please note that these suppliers also may contact you as necessary to obtain additional information about you, facilitate your travel reservation, or respond to a review you may submit.

We also may share your information: In response to subpoenas, court orders, or other legal process; to establish or exercise our legal rights; to defend against legal claims; or as otherwise required by law. In such cases we reserve the right to raise or waive any legal objection or right available to us. When we believe it is appropriate to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal or suspected illegal activities; to protect and defend the rights, property, or safety of our company or this website, our customers, or others; and in connection with our Terms of Service and other agreements. In connection with a corporate transaction, such as a divestiture, merger, consolidation, or asset sale, or in the unlikely event of bankruptcy. Other than as set out above, you will be notified when personal information about you will be shared with third parties, and you will have an opportunity to choose not to have us share such information.

You can choose not to receive tailored online advertising on other websites, based on your travel-related searches on this website, by clicking here or here. Note that if you choose not to receive tailored ads, you will still see online advertisements, but they will be more general and less relevant to you.

Information we receive and how it is used Information we receive about you We receive a number of different types of information about you, including: Your information Your information is the information that's required when you sign up for the site, as well as the information you choose to share. Registration information: When you sign up for Facebook, you are required to provide information such as your name, email address, birthday, and gender. In some cases, you may be able to register using other information, like your telephone number. Information you choose to share: Your information also includes the information you choose to share on Facebook, such as when you post a status update, upload a photo, or comment on a friend's story. It also includes the information you choose to share when you take an action, such as when you add a friend, like a Page or a website, add a place to your story, use our contact importers, or indicate you are in a relationship. Your name, profile pictures, cover photos, gender, networks, username and User ID are treated just like information you choose to make public. Your birthday allows us to do things like show you age-appropriate content and advertisements. Information others share about you We receive information about you from your friends and others, such as when they upload your contact information, post a photo of you, tag you in a photo or status update, or at a location, or add you to a group. When people use Facebook, they may store and share information about you and others that they have, such as when they upload and manage their invites and contacts. Other information we receive about you We also receive other types of information about you: We receive data about you whenever you interact with Facebook, such as when you look at another person's timeline, send or receive a message, search for a friend or a Page, click on, view or otherwise interact with things, use a Facebook mobile app, or purchase Facebook Credits or make other purchases through Facebook. When you post things like photos or videos on Facebook, we may receive additional related data (or metadata), such as the time, date, and place you took the photo or video. We receive data from the computer, mobile phone or other device you use to access Facebook, including when multiple users log in from the same device. This may include your IP address and other information about things like your internet service, location, the type (including identifiers) of browser you use, or the pages you visit. For example, we may get your GPS or other location information so we can tell you if any of your friends are nearby. We receive data whenever you visit a game, application, or website that uses Facebook Platform or visit a site with a Facebook feature (such as a social plugin), sometimes through cookies. This may include the date and time you visit the site; the web address, or URL, you're on; technical information about the IP address, browser and the operating system you use; and, if you are logged in to Facebook, your User ID. Sometimes we get data from our affiliates or our advertising partners, customers and other third parties that helps us (or them) deliver ads, understand online activity, and generally make Facebook better. For example, an advertiser may tell us information about you (like how you responded to an ad on Facebook or on another site) in order to measure the effectiveness of - and improve the quality of - ads. We also put together data from the information we already have about you and your friends. For example, we may put together data about you to determine which friends we should show you in your News Feed or suggest you tag in the photos you post. We may put together your current city with GPS and other location information we have about you to, for example, tell you and your friends about people or events nearby, or offer deals to you that you might be interested in. We may also put together data about you to serve you ads that might be more relevant to you. When we get your GPS location, we put it together with other location information we have about you (like your current city). But we only keep it until it is no longer useful to provide you services, like keeping your last GPS coordinates to send you relevant notifications. We only provide data to our advertising partners or customers after we have removed your name or any other personally identifying information from it, or have combined it with other people's data in a way that it is no longer associated with you. Public information When we use the phrase public information (which we sometimes refer to as Everyone information), we mean the information you choose to make public, as well as information that is always publicly available. Information you choose to make public Choosing to make your information public is exactly what it sounds like: anyone, including people off of Facebook, will be able to see it. Choosing to make your information public also means that this information: can be associated with you (i.e., your name, profile pictures, cover photos, timeline, User ID, username, etc.) even off Facebook; can show up when someone does a search on Facebook or on a public search engine; will be accessible to the Facebook-integrated games, applications, and websites you and your friends use; and will be accessible to anyone who uses our APIs such as our Graph API. Sometimes you will not be able to select an audience when you post something (like when you write on a Page's wall or comment on a news article that uses our comments plugin). This is because some types of stories are always public stories. As a general rule, you should assume that if you do not see a sharing icon, the information will be publicly available. When others share information about you, they can also choose to make it public. Information that is always publicly available The types of information listed below are always publicly available, and are treated just like information you decided to make public. Name: This helps your friends and family find you. If you are uncomfortable sharing your real name, you can always delete your account. Profile Pictures and Cover Photos: These help your friends and family recognize you. If you are uncomfortable making any of these photos public, you can always delete it. Unless you delete them, when you add a new profile picture or cover photo, the previous photo will remain public in your profile picture or cover photo album. Networks: This helps you see whom you will be sharing information with before you choose Friends and Networks as a custom audience. If you are uncomfortable making your network public, you can leave the network. Gender: This allows us to refer to you properly. Username and User ID: These allow you to give out a custom link to your timeline or Page, receive email at your Facebook email address, and help make Facebook Platform possible. Usernames and User IDs A Username (or Facebook URL) is a custom link to your timeline that you can give out to people or post on external websites. Usernames appear in the URL on your timeline. We also use your User ID to identify your Facebook account. If someone has your Username or User ID, they can use it to access information about you through the facebook.com website. For example, if someone has your Username, they can type facebook.com/Username into their browser and see your public information as well as anything else you've let them see. Similarly, someone with your Username or User ID can access information about you through our APIs, such as our Graph API. Specifically, they can access your public information, along with your age range, language and country. If you do not want your information to be accessible to Platform applications, you can turn off all Platform applications from your Privacy Settings. If you turn off Platform you will no longer be able to use any games or other applications until you turn Platform back on. For more information about the information that apps receive when you visit them, see Other websites and applications. If you want to see information available about you through our Graph API, just type https://graph.facebook.com/[User ID or Username]?metadata=1 into your browser. Your Facebook email address includes your public username like so: username@facebook.com. Anyone in a message conversation can reply to it. How we use the information we receive We use the information we receive about you in connection with the services and features we provide to you and other users like your friends, our partners, the advertisers that purchase ads on the site, and the developers that build the games, applications, and websites you use. For example, in addition to helping people see and find things that you do and share, we may use the information we receive about you: as part of our efforts to keep Facebook products, services and integrations safe and secure; to protect Facebook's or others' rights or property; to provide you with location features and services, like telling you and your friends when something is going on nearby; to measure or understand the effectiveness of ads you and others see, including to deliver relevant ads to you; to make suggestions to you and other users on Facebook, such as: suggesting that your friend use our contact importer because you found friends using it, suggesting that another user add you as a friend because the user imported the same email address as you did, or suggesting that your friend tag you in a picture they have uploaded with you in it; and for internal operations, including troubleshooting, data analysis, testing, research and service improvement. Granting us this permission not only allows us to provide Facebook as it exists today, but it also allows us to provide you with innovative features and services we develop in the future that use the information we receive about you in new ways. While you are allowing us to use the information we receive about you, you always own all of your information. Your trust is important to us, which is why we don't share information we receive about you with others unless we have: received your permission; given you notice, such as by telling you about it in this policy; or removed your name or any other personally identifying information from it. Of course, for information others share about you, they control how it is shared. We store data for as long as it is necessary to provide products and services to you and others, including those described above. Typically, information associated with your account will be kept until your account is deleted. For certain categories of data, we may also tell you about specific data retention practices. We are able to suggest that your friend tag you in a picture by scanning and comparing your friend's pictures to information we've put together from the other photos you've been tagged in. This allows us to make these suggestions. You can control whether we suggest that another user tag you in a photo using the “How Tags work” settings. Learn more at: https://www.facebook.com/help/tag-suggestions Deleting and deactivating your account If you want to stop using your account, you can either deactivate or delete it. Deactivate Deactivating your account puts your account on hold. Other users will no longer see your timeline, but we do not delete any of your information. Deactivating an account is the same as you telling us not to delete any information because you might want to reactivate your account at some point in the future. You can deactivate your account at: https://www.facebook.com/settings?tab=security Your friends will still see you listed in their list of friends while your account is deactivated. Deletion When you delete an account, it is permanently deleted from Facebook. It typically takes about one month to delete an account, but some information may remain in backup copies and logs for up to 90 days. You should only delete your account if you are sure you never want to reactivate it. You can delete your account at: https://www.facebook.com/help/contact.php?show_form=delete_account Learn more at: https://www.facebook.com/help/?faq=356107851084108 Certain information is needed to provide you with services, so we only delete this information after you delete your account. Some of the things you do on Facebook aren’t stored in your account, like posting to a group or sending someone a message (where your friend may still have a message you sent, even after you delete your account). That information remains after you delete your account. II. Sharing and finding you on Facebook Control each time you post Whenever you post content (like a status update, photo or check-in), you can select a specific audience, or even customize your audience. To do this, simply click on the sharing icon and choose who can see it. Choose this icon if you want to make something Public. Choosing to make something public is exactly what it sounds like. It means that anyone, including people off of Facebook, will be able to see or access it. Choose this icon if you want to share with your Facebook Friends. Choose this icon if you want to Customize your audience. You can also use this to hide your story from specific people. If you tag someone, that person and their friends can see your story no matter what audience you selected. The same is true when you approve a tag someone else adds to your story. Always think before you post. Just like anything else you post on the web or send in an email, information you share on Facebook can be copied or re-shared by anyone who can see it. Although you choose with whom you share, there may be ways for others to determine information about you. For example, if you hide your birthday so no one can see it on your timeline, but friends post “happy birthday!” on your timeline, people may determine your birthday. When you comment on or like someone else's story, or write on their timeline, that person gets to select the audience. For example, if a friend posts a Public story and you comment on it, your comment will be Public. Often, you can see the audience someone selected for their story before you post a comment; however, the person who posted the story may later change their audience. You can control who can see the Facebook Pages you've liked by visiting your timeline, clicking on the Likes box on your timeline, and then clicking Edit. Sometimes you will not see a sharing icon when you post something (like when you write on a Page's wall or comment on a news article that uses our comments plugin). This is because some types of stories are always public stories. As a general rule, you should assume that if you do not see a sharing icon, the information will be publicly available. Control over your timeline Whenever you add things to your timeline you can select a specific audience, or even customize your audience. To do this, simply click on the sharing icon and choose who can see it. Choose this icon if you want to make something Public. Choosing to make something public is exactly what it sounds like. It means that anyone, including people off of Facebook, will be able to see or access it. Choose this icon if you want to share with your Facebook Friends. Choose this icon if you want to Customize your audience. You can also use this to hide the item on your timeline from specific people. When you select an audience for your friend list, you are only controlling who can see the entire list of your friends on your timeline. We call this a timeline visibility control. This is because your friend list is always available to the games, applications and websites you use, and your friendships may be visible elsewhere (such as on your friends' timelines or in searches). For example, if you select Only Me as the audience for your friend list, but your friend sets her friend list to Public, anyone will be able to see your connection on your friend's timeline. Similarly, if you choose to hide your gender, it only hides it on your timeline. This is because we, just like the applications you and your friends use, need to use your gender to refer to you properly on the site. When someone tags you in a story (such as a photo, status update or check-in), you can choose whether you want that story to appear on your timeline. You can either approve each story individually or approve all stories by your friends. If you approve a story and later change your mind, you can remove it from your timeline. When you hide things on your timeline, like posts or connections, it means those things will not appear on your timeline. But, remember, anyone in the audience of those posts or who can see a connection may still see it elsewhere, like on someone else's timeline or in search results. You can also delete or change the audience of content you post. People on Facebook may be able to see mutual friends, even if they cannot see your entire list of friends. Some things (like your name, profile pictures and cover photos) do not have sharing icons because they are always publicly available. As a general rule, you should assume that if you do not see a sharing icon, the information will be publicly available. Finding you on Facebook To make it easier for your friends to find you, we allow anyone with your contact information (such as email address or telephone number) to find you through the Facebook search bar at the top of most pages, as well as other tools we provide, such as contact importers - even if you have not shared your contact information with them on Facebook. You can choose who can look up your timeline using the email address or telephone number you added to your timeline through your privacy settings. But remember that people can still find you or a link to your timeline on Facebook through other people and the things they share about you or through other posts, like if you are tagged in a friend's photo or post something to a public page. Your settings do not control whether people can find you or a link to your timeline when they search for content they have permission to see, like a photo or other story you’ve been tagged in. Access on phones and other devices Once you share information with your friends and others, they may be able to sync it with or access it via their mobile phones and other devices. For example, if you share a photo on Facebook, someone viewing that photo could save it using Facebook tools or by other methods offered by their device or browser. Similarly, if you share your contact information with someone or invite someone to an event, they may be able to use Facebook or third party applications or devices to sync that information. Or, if one of your friends has a Facebook application on one of their devices, your information (such as the things you post or photos you share) may be stored on or accessed by their device. You should only share information with people you trust because they will be able to save it or re-share it with others, including when they sync the information "
	+ "to a device. Activity log Your activity log is a place where you can go to view most of your information on Facebook, including things you’ve hidden from your timeline. You can use this log to manage your content. For example, you can do things like delete stories, change the audience of your stories or stop an application from publishing to your timeline on your behalf. When you hide something from your timeline, you are not deleting it. This means that the story may be visible elsewhere, like in your friends’ News Feed. If you want to delete a story you posted, choose the delete option. What your friends and others share about you Links and Tags Anyone can add a link to a story. Links are references to something on the Internet; anything from a website to a Page or timeline on Facebook. For example, if you are writing a story, you might include a link to a blog you are referencing or a link to the blogger’s Facebook timeline. If someone clicks on a link to another person’s timeline, they’ll only see the things that they are allowed to see. A tag is a special type of link to someone’s timeline that suggests that the tagged person add your story to their timeline. In cases where the tagged person isn’t included in the audience of the story, it will add them so they can see it. Anyone can tag you in anything. Once you are tagged, you and your friends will be able to see it (such as in News Feed or in search). You can choose whether a story you've been tagged in appears on your timeline. You can either approve each story individually or approve all stories by your friends. If you approve a story and later change your mind, you can always remove it from your timeline. If you do not want someone to tag you, we encourage you to reach out to them and give them that feedback. If that does not work, you can block them. This will prevent them from tagging you going forward. If you are linked to or tagged in a private space (such as a message or a group) only the people who can see the private space can see the link or tag. Similarly, if you are linked to or tagged in a comment, only the people who can see the comment can see the link or tag. Other information As described in the what your friends and others share about you section of this policy, your friends and others may share information about you. They may share photos or other information about you and tag you in their posts. If you do not like a particular post, tell them or report the post. Groups Once you are in a Group, anyone in that Group can add you to a subgroup. When someone adds you to a Group, you will be listed as “invited” until you visit the Group. You can always leave a Group, which will prevent others from adding you to it again. Pages Facebook Pages are public pages. Companies use Pages to share information about their products. Celebrities use Pages to talk about their latest projects. And communities use pages to discuss topics of interest, everything from baseball to the opera. Because Pages are public, information you share with a Page is public information. This means, for example, that if you post a comment on a Page, that comment may be used by the Page owner off Facebook, and anyone can see it. When you like a Page, you create a connection to that Page. The connection is added to your timeline and your friends may see it in their News Feeds. You may be contacted by or receive updates from the Page, such as in your News Feed and your messages. You can remove the Pages you've liked through your timeline or on the Page. Some Pages contain content that comes directly from the Page owner. Page owners can do this through online plugins, such as an iframe, and it works just like the games and other applications you use through Facebook. Because this content comes directly from the Page owner, that Page may be able to collect information about you, just like any website. Page administrators may have access to insights data, which will tell them generally about the people that visit their Page (as opposed to information about specific people). They may also know when you’ve made a connection to their Page because you’ve liked their Page or posted a comment. III. Other websites and applications About Facebook Platform Facebook Platform (or simply Platform) refers to the way we help you share your information with the games, applications, and websites you and your friends use. Facebook Platform also lets you bring your friends with you, so you can connect with them off of Facebook. In these two ways, Facebook Platform helps you make your experiences on the web more personalized and social. Remember that these games, applications and websites are created and maintained by other businesses and developers who are not part of, or controlled by, Facebook, so you should always make sure to read their terms of service and privacy policies to understand how they treat your data. Controlling what information you share with applications When you connect with a game, application or website - such as by going to a game, logging in to a website using your Facebook account, or adding an app to your timeline - we give the game, application, or website (sometimes referred to as just Applications or Apps) your basic info (we sometimes call this your public profile), which includes your User ID and your public information. We also give them your friends' User IDs (also called your friend list) as part of your basic info. Your friend list helps the application make your experience more social because it lets you find your friends on that application. Your User ID helps the application personalize your experience because it can connect your account on that application with your Facebook account, and it can access your basic info, which includes your public information and friend list. This includes the information you choose to make public, as well as information that is always publicly available. If the application needs additional information, such as your stories, photos or likes, it will have to ask you for specific permission. The “Apps you use” setting lets you control the applications you use. You can see the permissions you have given these applications, the last time an application accessed your information, and the audience on Facebook for timeline stories and activity the application posts on your behalf. You can also remove applications you no longer want, or turn off all Platform applications. When you turn all Platform applications off, your User ID is no longer given to applications, even when your friends use those applications. But you will no longer be able to use any games, applications or websites through Facebook. When you first visit an app, Facebook lets the app know your language, your country, and whether you are in an age group, for instance, under 18, between 18-20, or 21 and over. Age range lets apps provide you with age-appropriate content. If you install the app, it can access, store and update the information you’ve shared. Apps you’ve installed can update their records of your basic info, age range, language and country. If you haven’t used an app in a while, it won’t be able to continue to update the additional information you’ve given them permission to access. Learn more at: https://www.facebook.com/help/how-apps-work Sometimes a game console, mobile phone, or other device might ask for permission to share specific information with the games and applications you use on that device. If you say okay, those applications will not be able to access any other information about you without asking specific permission from you or your friends. Sites and apps that use Instant Personalization receive your User ID and friend list when you visit them. You always can remove apps you’ve installed by using your app settings at: https://www.facebook.com/settings/?tab=applications. But remember, apps may still be able to access your information when the people you share with use them. And, if you’ve removed an application and want them to delete the information you’ve already shared with them, you should contact the application and ask them to delete it. Visit the application’s page on Facebook or their own website to learn more about the app. For example, Apps may have reasons (e.g. legal obligations) to retain some data that you share with them. Controlling what is shared when the people you share with use applications Just like when you share information by email or elsewhere on the web, information you share on Facebook can be re-shared. This means that if you share something on Facebook, anyone who can see it can share it with others, including the games, applications, and websites they use. Your friends and the other people you share information with often want to share your information with applications to make their experiences on those applications more personalized and social. For example, one of your friends might want to use a music application that allows them to see what their friends are listening to. To get the full benefit of that application, your friend would want to give the application her friend list – which includes your User ID – so the application knows which of her friends is also using it. Your friend might also want to share the music you “like” on Facebook. If you have made that information public, then the application can access it just like anyone else. But if you’ve shared your likes with just your friends, the application could ask your friend for permission to share them. You can control most of the information other people can share with applications they use from the “Ads, Apps and Websites” settings page. But these controls do not let you limit access to your public information and friend list. If you want to completely block applications from getting your information when your friends and others use them, you will need to turn off all Platform applications. This means that you will no longer be able to use any third-party Facebook-integrated games, applications or websites. If an application asks permission from someone else to access your information, the application will be allowed to use that information only in connection with the person that gave the permission and no one else. Logging in to another site using Facebook Facebook Platform lets you log into other applications and websites using your Facebook account. When you log in using Facebook, we give the site your User ID (just like when you connect with any other application), but we do not share your email address or password with that website through this process without your permission. If you already have an account on that website, the site may also be able to connect that account with your Facebook account. Sometimes it does this using what is called an email hash, which is similar to searching for someone on Facebook using an email address. Only the email addresses in this case are hashed so no email addresses are actually shared between Facebook and the website. How it works The website sends over a hashed version of your email address, and we match it with a database of email addresses that we have also hashed. If there is a match, then we tell the website the User ID associated with the email address. This way, when you log into the website using Facebook, the website can link your Facebook account to your account on that website. About social plugins Social plugins are buttons, boxes, and stories (such as the Like button) that other websites can use to present Facebook content to you and create more social and personal experiences for you. While you view these buttons, boxes, and stories on other sites, the content comes directly from Facebook. Sometimes plugins act just like applications. You can spot one of these plugins because it will ask you for permission to access your information or to publish information back to Facebook. For example, if you use a registration plugin on a website, the plugin will ask your permission to share your basic info with the website to make it easier for you to register for the website. Similarly, if you use an Add To Timeline plugin, the plugin will ask your permission to publish stories about your activities on that website to Facebook. If you make something public using a plugin, such as posting a public comment on a newspaper's website, then that website can access your comment (along with your User ID) just like everyone else. If you post something using a social plugin and you do not see a sharing icon, you should assume that story is Public. For example, if you post a comment through a Facebook comment plugin on a site, your story is Public and everyone, including the website, can see your story. Websites that use social plugins can sometimes tell that you have engaged with the social plugin. For example, they may know that you clicked on a Like button in a social plugin. We receive data when you visit a site with a social plugin. We keep this data for a maximum of 90 days. After that, we remove your name or any other personally identifying information from the data, or combine it with other people's data in a way that it is no longer associated with you. Learn more at: https://www.facebook.com/help/social-plugins About instant personalization Instant personalization (sometimes also referred to as Start now) is a way for Facebook to help partners (such as Bing and Rotten Tomatoes) on and off Facebook create a more personalized and social experience for logged in users than a social plugin can offer. When you visit a site or app using instant personalization, it will know some information about you and your friends the moment you arrive. This is because sites and apps using instant personalization can access your User ID, your friend list, and your public information. The first time you visit a site or app using instant personalization, you will see a notification letting you know that the site or app has partnered with Facebook to provide a personalized experience. The notification will give you the ability to disable or turn off instant personalization for that site or app. If you do that, that site or app is required to delete all of the information about you it received from Facebook as part of the instant personalization program. In addition, we will prevent that site from accessing your information in the future, even when your friends use that site. If you decide that you do not want to experience instant personalization for all partner sites and apps, you can disable instant personalization from the “Ads, Apps and Websites” settings page. If you turn off instant personalization, these partner third party sites and apps will not be able to access your public information, even when your friends visit those sites. If you turn off an instant personalization site or app after you have been using it or visited it a few times (or after you have given it specific permission to access your data), it will not automatically delete information about you it received through Facebook. Like all other apps, the site is required by our policies to delete information about you if you ask it to. How it works To join the instant personalization program, a potential partner must enter into an agreement with us designed to protect your privacy. For example, this agreement requires that the partner delete information about you if you turn off instant personalization when you first visit the site or app. It also prevents the partner from accessing any information about you until you or your friends visit its site. Instant personalization partners sometimes use an email hash process to see if any of their users are on Facebook and get those users' User IDs. This process is similar to searching for someone on Facebook using an email address, except in this case the email addresses are hashed so no actual email addresses are exchanged. The partner is also contractually required not to use your User ID for any purpose (other than associating it with your account) until you or your friends visit the site. When you visit a site or app using instant personalization, we provide the site or app with your User ID and your friend list (as well as your age range, locale, and gender). The site or app can then connect your account with that partner with your friends' accounts to make the site or app instantly social. The site can also access public information associated with any of the User IDs it receives, which it can use to make them instantly personalized. For example, if the site is a music site, it can access your music interests to suggest songs you may like, and access your friends' music interests to let you know what they are listening to. Of course it can only access your or your friends’ music interests if they are public. If the site or app wants any additional information, it will have to get your specific permission. Public search engines Your public search setting controls whether people who enter your name on a public search engine may see your public timeline (including in sponsored results). You can find your public search setting on the “Ads, Apps and Websites” settings page. This setting does not apply to search engines that access your information as an application using Facebook Platform. If you turn your public search setting off and then search for yourself on a public search engine, you may still see a preview of your timeline. This is because some search engines cache information for a period of time. You can learn more about how to request a search engine to remove you from cached information at: https://www.facebook.com/help/?faq=13323 IV. How advertising and Sponsored Stories work Personalized ads We do not share any of your information with advertisers (unless, of course, you give us permission). As described in this policy, we may share your information when we have removed from it anything that personally identifies you or combined it with other information so that it no longer personally identifies you. We use the information we receive, including the information you provide at registration or add to your account or timeline, to deliver ads and to make them more relevant to you. This includes all of the things you share and do on Facebook, such as the Pages you like or key words from your stories, and the things we infer from your use of Facebook. Learn more at: https://www.facebook.com/help/?page=226611954016283 When an advertiser creates an ad, they are given the opportunity to choose their audience by location, demographics, likes, keywords, and any other information we receive or can tell about you and other users. For example, an advertiser can choose to target 18 to 35 year-old women who live in the United States and like basketball. An advertiser could also choose to target certain topics or keywords, like “music” or even people who like a particular song or artist. If you indicate that you are interested in topics, such as by liking a Page, including topics such as products, brands, religion, health status, or political views, you may see ads related to those topics as well. We require advertisers to comply with our Advertising Guidelines, including provisions relating to the use of sensitive data. Try this tool yourself to see one of the ways advertisers target ads and what information they see at: https://www.facebook.com/ads/create/ If the advertiser chooses to run the ad (also known as placing the order), we serve the ad to people who meet the criteria the advertiser selected, but we do not tell the advertiser who any of those people are. So, for example, if a person views or otherwise interacts with the ad, the advertiser might infer that the person is an 18-to-35-year-old woman who lives in the U.S. and likes basketball. But we would not tell the advertiser who that person is. After the ad runs, we provide advertisers with reports on how their ads performed. For example we give advertisers reports telling them how many users saw or clicked on their ads. But these reports are anonymous. We do not tell advertisers who saw or clicked on their ads. Advertisers or their partners sometimes "
	+ "place cookies on your computer (or use other similar system technologies) in order to serve ads and to make their ads more effective. Learn more about cookies, pixels and other system technologies. Sometimes we allow advertisers to target a category of user, like a moviegoer or a sci-fi fan. We do this by bundling characteristics that we believe are related to the category. For example, if a person likes the Star Trek Page and mentions Star Wars when they check into a movie theater, we may conclude that this person is likely to be a sci-fi fan. Advertisers of sci-fi movies, for example, could ask us to target “sci-fi fans” and we would target that group, which may include you. Or if you “like” Pages that are car-related and mention a particular car brand in a post, we might put you in the “potential car buyer” category and let a car brand target to that group, which would include you. Ads + social context Facebook Ads are sometimes paired with social actions your friends have taken. For example, an ad for a sushi restaurant may be paired with a news story that one of your friends likes that restaurant's Facebook page. This is the same type of news story that could show up in your News Feed, only we place it next to a paid advertisement to make that ad more relevant and interesting. When you show up in one of these news stories, we will only pair it with ads shown to your friends. If you do not want to appear in stories paired with Facebook Ads, you can opt out using your “Edit social ads” setting. Learn what happens when you click Like on an advertisement or an advertiser's Facebook Page at: https://www.facebook.com/help/?faq=19399 We may serve ads, including those with social context (or serve just social context), on other sites. These work just like the ads we serve on Facebook - the advertisers do not receive any of your information. Only people that could see the Facebook action (like on your timeline) would see it paired in this way. Your “Show my social actions in Facebook Ads” setting only controls ads with social context. It does not control Sponsored Stories, ads or information about Facebook's services and features, or other Facebook content. Games, applications and websites can serve ads directly to you or help us serve ads to you or others if they have information like your User ID or email address. Sponsored stories Many of the things you do on Facebook (like liking a Page) are posted to your timeline and shared in News Feed. But there's a lot to read in News Feed. That's why we allow people to sponsor your stories to make sure your friends and subscribers see them. For example, if you RSVP to an event hosted by a local restaurant, that restaurant may want to make sure your friends see it so they can come too. If they do sponsor a story, that story will appear in the same place ads usually do or in your News Feed under the heading Sponsored or something similar. Only people that could originally see the story can see the sponsored story, and no personal information about you (or your friends) is shared with the sponsor. Your “Show my social actions in Facebook Ads” setting only controls ads with social context. It does not control Sponsored Stories, ads or information about Facebook's services and features, or other Facebook content. Facebook content We like to tell you about some of the features and tools your friends and others use on Facebook, to help you have a better experience. For example, if your friend uses our friend finder tool to find more friends on Facebook, we may tell you about it to encourage you to use it as well. This of course means your friend may similarly see suggestions based on the things you do. But we will try to only show it to friends that could benefit from your experience. Your “Show my social actions in Facebook Ads” setting only controls ads with social context. It does not control Sponsored Stories, ads or information about Facebook's services and features, or other Facebook content. V. Cookies, pixels and other similar technologies Cookies are small pieces of data that are stored on your computer, mobile phone or other device. Pixels are small blocks of code on webpages that do things like allow another server to measure viewing of a webpage and often are used in connection with cookies. We use technologies like cookies, pixels, and local storage (like on your browser or device, which is similar to a cookie but holds more information) to provide and understand a range of products and services. Learn more at: https://www.facebook.com/help/cookies We use these technologies to do things like: make Facebook easier or faster to use; enable features and store information about you (including on your device or in your browser cache) and your use of Facebook; deliver, understand and improve advertising; monitor and understand the use of our products and services; and to protect you, others and Facebook. For example, we may use them to know you are logged in to Facebook, to help you use social plugins and share buttons, or to know when you are interacting with our advertising or Platform partners. We may ask advertisers or other partners to serve ads or services to computers, mobile phones or other devices, which may use a cookie, pixel or other similar technology placed by Facebook or the third party (although we would not share any other information that identifies you with an advertiser). Most companies on the web use cookies (or other similar technological tools), including our advertising and Platform partners. For example, our Platform partners, advertisers or Page administrators may use cookies or similar technologies when you access their apps, ads, Pages or other content. Cookies and things like local storage help make Facebook work, like allowing pages to load faster because certain content is stored on your browser or by helping us authenticate you to deliver personalized content. To learn more about how advertisers generally use cookies and the choices advertisers provide, visit the Network Advertising Initiative at http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp, the Digital Advertising Alliance at http://www.aboutads.info/, the Internet Advertising Bureau (US) at http://www.iab.net or the Internet Advertising Bureau (EU) at http://youronlinechoices.eu/. Refer to your browser or device's help material to learn what controls you can often use to remove or block cookies or other similar technologies or block or remove other data stored on your computer or device (such as by using the various settings in your browser). If you do this, it may affect your ability to use Facebook or other websites and apps. VI.

This may include responding to legal requests from jurisdictions outside of the United States where we have a good faith belief that the response is required by law in that jurisdiction, affects users in that jurisdiction, and is consistent with internationally recognized standards. We may also access, preserve and share information when we have a good faith belief it is necessary to: detect, prevent and address fraud and other illegal activity; to protect ourselves, you and others, including as part of investigations; and to prevent death or imminent bodily harm. Information we receive about you, including financial transaction data related to purchases made with Facebook Credits, may be accessed, processed and retained for an extended period of time when it is the subject of a legal request or obligation, governmental investigation, or investigations concerning possible violations of our terms or policies, or otherwise to prevent harm. We also may retain information from accounts disabled for violations of our terms for at least a year to prevent repeat abuse or other violations of our terms. Access requests You can access and correct most of your personal data stored by Facebook by logging into your account and viewing your timeline and activity log. You can also download a copy of your personal data by visiting your “Account Settings”, clicking on “Download a copy of your Facebook data” and then clicking on the link for your expanded archive. Learn more at: https://www.facebook.com/help/?faq=226281544049399 Notifications and Other Messages We may send you notifications and other messages using the contact information we have for you, like your email address. You can control most of the notifications you receive, including ones from Pages you like and applications you use, using controls we provide, such as a control included in the email you receive or in your “Notifications” settings. Friend finder We offer tools to help you upload your friends' contact information so that you and others can find friends on Facebook, and invite friends who do not use Facebook to join, and so we can offer you and others better experiences on Facebook through suggestions and other customized experiences. If you do not want us to store this information, visit this help page at: https://www.facebook.com/contact_importer/remove_uploads.php. If you give us your password, we will delete it after you upload your friends' contact information. Invitations When you invite a friend to join Facebook, we send a message on your behalf using your name, and we may also include names and pictures of other people your friend might know on Facebook. We'll also send a few reminders to those you invite, but the invitation will also give your friend the opportunity to opt out of receiving other invitations to join Facebook. Memorializing accounts We may memorialize the account of a deceased person. When we memorialize an account, we keep the timeline on Facebook, but limit access and some features. You can report a deceased person's timeline at: https://www.facebook.com/help/contact.php?show_form=deceased We also may close an account if we receive a formal request that satisfies certain criteria. Affiliates We may share information we receive with businesses that are legally part of the same group of companies that Facebook is part of, or that become part of that group (often these companies are called affiliates). Likewise, our affiliates may share information with us as well. This sharing is done in compliance with applicable laws including where such applicable laws require consent. We and our affiliates may use shared information to help provide, understand, and improve our services and their own services. Service Providers We give your information to the people and companies that help us provide, understand and improve the services we offer. For example, we may use outside vendors to help host our website, serve photos and videos, process payments, analyze data, conduct and publish research, measure the effectiveness of ads, or provide search results. In some cases we provide the service jointly with another company, such as the Facebook Marketplace. In all of these cases our partners must agree to only use your information consistent with the agreement we enter into with them, as well as this Data Use Policy. Security and bugs We do our best to keep your information secure, but we need your help. For more detailed information about staying safe on Facebook, visit the Facebook Security Page. We try to keep Facebook up, bug-free and safe, but can’t make guarantees about any part of our services or products. Change of Control If the ownership of our business changes, we may transfer your information to the new owner so they can continue to operate the service. But they will still have to honor the commitments we have made in this Data Use Policy. Notice of Changes If we make changes to this Data Use Policy we will notify you (for example, by publication here and on the Facebook Site Governance Page). If the changes are material, we will provide you additional, prominent notice as appropriate under the circumstances. You can make sure that you receive notice directly by liking the Facebook Site Governance Page. Opportunity to comment Unless we make a change for legal or administrative reasons, or to correct an inaccurate statement, we will give you seven (7) days to provide us with comments on the change. After the comment period, if we adopt any changes, we will provide notice (for example, on the Facebook Site Governance Page or in this policy) of the effective date.

	sessionStorage.setItem("TRAIND", "FilesTube Privacy Policy Your privacy is our top concern. We work hard to earn and keep Your trust, so we adhere to the following principles to protect Your privacy: We do not rent or sell Your personally identifiable information to third parties for marketing purposes. We do not share Your contact information with another User without Your consent. Any personally identifiable information that You provide will be secured with industry standard protocols and technology. We provide this Privacy Policy to inform You of our policies and procedures regarding the collection, use and disclosure of the personal and other information we receive from Users of the FilesTube Site. We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time and will handle Your information in accordance with the version that was in place when You submitted it. We will notify You of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on the Site. We reserve the right to modify this Privacy Policy at any time, so please review it frequently. If we make material changes to this Privacy Policy, we will notify You here, by email, or by means of a notice on the home page of the Site. Unless otherwise defined in this Privacy Policy, terms used in this Privacy Policy have the same meanings as in our Terms of Use. By continuing to use the FilesTube Service after notice of changes have been sent to You or published on the FilesTube Site, You are consenting to the changes. The purpose of the FilesTube Site is to provide its Users with an infrastructure which enables the Users to search files in various file sharing and uploading sites like RapidShare, MegaUpload, Uploading.com, SendSpace, FileFactory and many oth ers. As an file sharing search engine FilesTube finds files matching your search criteria among the files that have been seen recently in uploading sites by our search spider. This information is accumulated in a database. When you execute a FilesTube search it delivers results from the database. With our unique approach to crawling you can find the files shared on uploading sites that the other crawlers miss. Also our search engine collects rich and relevant metadata for each page. As a result, when you search for files (video, music, software, documents etc) with FilesTube, you can always find high-quality, relevant search results. FilesTube links its Users with the file-sharing and torrent networks. None of the torrent files, peers or content is controlled by FilesTube administrators or servers. The same applies to the filesharing networks. None of the files stored remotely, nor the users that have uploaded them are controlled by FilesTube administrators or servers. You willingly provide us certain personal information, which we collect in order to allow You to benefit from the FilesTube Site. If You have any hesitation about providing such information to us or otherwise used in any manner permitted in this Privacy Policy and the Terms of Use, You should not become a User of FilesTube. The FilesTube Site and Third Party Sites This Privacy Policy applies solely to the FilesTube Site. The Site may contain links to third party sites that are not owned or controlled by FilesTube. FilesTube has no control over, and assumes no responsibility for, the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third party site. You agree that You are responsible for reviewing and understanding the privacy policies (if any) of any third party sites You may access through this Site. By using this Site, You release FilesTube from any and all liability arising from Your use of any third party site to which this Site may be linked. Our primary goals in collecting information are to provide and improve the Service, the Site and the related features, to administer Your subscription and to enable Users to enjoy and easily navigate the Site. Below are the types and categories of information that we collect. Personal Information Collected We collect Your personal information in the following ways: Account In order to become a User, You do not need to create an account on our Site. In order to access some features of the FilesTube or other elements of the Service, you will have to create a FilesTube account. When creating your account You benefit from number of different Services we provide to help You take advantage of our unique file search solution. In this respect You are required to provide the following contact information, which You recognize and expressly acknowledge is personal information allowing others, including FilesTube, to identify You: email address, username and a password chosen by You. It is important that you must keep your FilesTube account password secure and confidential. Log Data When You visit the Site or use the Service, whether as a FilesTube subscriber or a non-registered User just browsing our servers FilesTube automatically records information about Your use of the Service and Your visit to the Site (Log Data). The Log Data may include information such as Your computer's Internet Protocol (IP) address, Your browser type, what Software You were using, the web page You were visiting immediately prior to visiting our Site, pages of our Site that You visited, the time spent on those pages, information You searched for on our Site, access times and dates, and other statistics. We use this information to monitor and analyze use of the Site and the Service and for the Site's technical administration, to improve our Site's functionality and User-friendliness, and to better tailor it to our visitors' needs. We also use this information to verify that Users of the Service meet the criteria required to process their requests. Cookies Like most Sites, FilesTube uses cookies and web log files to track site usage. A cookie is a tiny data file which resides on Your computer which allows FilesTube to recognize You as a User when You return to the FilesTube Site using the same computer and web browser. If Your browser settings do not allow cookies, You will not be able to use the FilesTube Site. Like the information You enter at registration, cookie and log file data is used to customize Your experience on our Site. One type of cookie, known as a “persistent” cookie, is set once You’ve logged in to Your FilesTube account. The next time You visit the FilesTube Site, the persistent cookie will allow us to recognize You as an existing User so You will not need to log in before using the Service. Additionally, if You log out of the FilesTube Site You will need to re-enter Your password the next time You visit in order to log in to Your account. Another type of cookie, called a “session” cookie, is used to identify a particular visit to the FilesTube Site. Session cookies expire after a short time or when You close Your web browser. We use cookies to improve the quality of our Service by storing User preferences and tracking User trends. In the course of serving advertisements or optimizing Services to our Users, we may allow authorized third parties to place or recognize a unique cookie on Your browser. Any information provided to third parties through such cookies will not be personally identifiable. Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies, but You can reset Your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. Unfortunately, if Your browser settings do not allow cookies or You opt to refuse all cookies, You may not be able to use the FilesTube Site or Services. FilesTube does not store personally identifiable information in the cookies. Web Beacons We allow other companies, called ad networks, to serve advertisements to Users. Ad networks include third party ad servers, ad agencies, ad technology vendors and research firms. To deliver these ads properly, FilesTube may include a file, called a web beacon, from these ad networks within pages served by FilesTube so the networks may provide anonymized, aggregated auditing, research and reporting for advertisers as well as to target ads to You while You visit other sites. Because Your web browser must request these advertisements and web beacons from the ad network’s servers, these companies can view, edit or set their own cookies, just as if You had requested a web page from their site. These general targets may also be used by ad networks to display targeted ads on other sites as a substitute for random, irrelevant ads. FilesTube does not provide personally identifiable information to any advertiser or any other third party. Log files, IP addresses and information about Your computer Due to the communications standards on the Internet, when You visit the FilesTube Site we automatically receive the URL of the site from which You came and the site to which You are going when You leave FilesTube. We also receive the Internet protocol (IP) address of Your computer (or the proxy server You use to access the World Wide Web), Your computer operating system and type of web browser You are using, email patterns, as well as the name of Your ISP. This information is used to analyze overall trends to help us improve the FilesTube Service. The linkage between Your IP address and Your personally identifiable information is not shared with third-parties without Your permission or except when required by law. FilesTube Communications FilesTube will communicate with You through email and notices posted on the FilesTube Site or through other means available through the Service, including text and other forms of messaging. FilesTube may use your email address without further consent for non-marketing or administrative purposes (such as notifying you of major FilesTube changes or for customer service purposes). If we send any communications to You via the carrier service with which You have a mobile communications subscription or otherwise have access, You understand You will pay any service fees associated with any such access (including text messaging charges for messages to Your mobile device). Please be aware that You will always receive certain emails from FilesTube related to the proper functioning of Your account. You can change Your e-mail and contact preferences at any time by logging into Your account and amending Your email notification choices. By clicking Sing up during the registration process, You also consent to receive commercial or marketing messages from FilesTube and/or Partners in Your email. Sharing Information with Third Parties FilesTube takes the privacy of Users very seriously. We do not sell, rent, or otherwise provide Your personally identifiable information to third parties for marketing purposes. We will only share Your personally identifiable information with third parties to carry out Your instructions or to provide specific Services or information. These third parties do not retain, share, or store any personally identifiable information except to provide these Services and they are bound by confidentiality agreements which limit their use of such information. We may provide aggregated anonymous data about the usage of our Services to third parties for such purposes as we deem, in our sole discretion, to be appropriate, including to prospective advertisers on FilesTube. Teaming with Other Organizations to Offer Combined and Other Services FilesTube may offer our Services in connection with other sites (including updates about the FilesTube Service) or may team with other online services to give You the combined results of both services or additional services and benefits. Platform Applications can be designed by Platform Developers or by a subset of Platform Developers with whom FilesTube has more closely aligned (“Partners”). In the case of Partners, we do some vetting and we only work with trusted Partners. Because of FilesTube’s trust in these Partners, Platform Applications or services designed by a Partner may be automatically granted permission to access account information to provide the combined services. For Platform Applications designed by most Platform Developers, You will be asked to confirm acceptance of the Platform Developers’ respective privacy policies and User agreements, which have not necessarily been reviewed or approved by FilesTube. In these cases, it will be Your choice whether or not to make use of the services and whether to proceed under the Platform Developers’ terms. Platform Developers are required to agree to restrictions on access, storage and usage of Your information. However, while we typically enter into contractual agreements and take technical steps to restrict possible misuse of such information by such Platform Developers, we may not screen or approve Platform Developers, and we cannot and do not guarantee that all Platform Developers will abide by such restrictions and agreements. FilesTube is not responsible for Your use of or inability to use any Platform Applications, including the content, accuracy, or reliability of such applications and the privacy practices or other policies of Platform Developers. FilesTube allows other companies to place advertisements on the Site. These companies use technology to deliver advertisements You see on the Site directly to Your browser. In doing so, they may automatically receive Your IP address. Other companies that place advertising on the Site may have the ability to use cookies and/or web beacons to collect information, including information about Your usage of the Site. We do not control the processes that advertisers use to collect information. However, IP addresses, cookies and web beacons alone generally cannot be used to identify individuals, only machines. Therefore, advertisers and others whose advertisements or content may appear on the Site generally will not know who You are unless You provide additional information to them, by responding to an advertisement, by entering into an agreement with them, or by some other means. Legal Disclaimer FilesTube cooperates with government and law enforcement officials and private parties to enforce and comply with the law. We will disclose any information about You to government or law enforcement officials or private parties as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate to respond to claims and legal process (including without limitation subpoenas), to protect the property and rights of FilesTube or a third party, to protect the safety of the public or any person, or to prevent or stop activity we consider to be illegal or unethical. Disclosures to others We may also disclose Your personal and other information You provide, to another third party as part of a reorganization or a sale of the assets of a FilesTube division or company. Any third party to which we transfer or sell FilesTube’s assets will have the right to continue to use the personal and other information that You provide to us. Phishing Identity theft and the practice currently known as phishing are of great concern to FilesTube. Safeguarding information to help protect You from identity theft is a top priority. We do not and will not, at any time, request Your credit card information, Your account ID, login password in a non-secure or unsolicited e-mail or telephone communication. Aggregate Information and Non-Identifying Information We may share aggregated information that does not include personal Information and we may otherwise disclose Non-Identifying Information and Log Data with third parties for industry analysis, demographic profiling and other purposes. Any aggregated information shared in these contexts will not contain Your personal Information. International Transfer Your information may be transferred to and maintained on computers located outside of Your state, province, country or other governmental jurisdiction where the privacy laws may not be as protective as those in Your jurisdiction. Your consent to this Privacy Policy followed by Your submission of such information represents Your agreement to such transfer. Links to Other Sites Our Site contains links to other web sites. If You choose to visit an advertiser by clicking on a banner ad or other type of advertisement, or click on another third party link, You will be directed to that third party's web site. The fact that we link to a web site or present a banner ad or other type of advertisement is not an endorsement, authorization or representation of our affiliation with that third party, nor is it an endorsement of their privacy or information security policies or practices. We do not exercise control over third party web sites. These other web sites may place their own cookies or other files on Your computer, collect data or solicit personal information from You. Other sites follow different rules regarding the use or disclosure of the personal information You submit to them. We encourage You to read the privacy policies or statements of the other web sites You visit. Accessing and Changing Your Account Information You can review the information You provided us and make any desired changes to them, or to the settings for Your FilesTube account including Your email at any time by logging in to Your account on the FilesTube Site. Please be aware that even after Your request for a change is processed, FilesTube may, for a time, retain residual information about You in its backup and/or archival copies of its database.

Methods to Collect Information and Interest-Based/Online Behavioral Advertising: A “cookie” is a small text file that helps us in many ways to make your visit to our website more enjoyable and meaningful to you. For example, cookies avoid you having to log in every time you come back to one of our websites. They also allow us to tailor a website or advertisement to better match your interests and preferences. There are a couple different types of cookies. A “session” cookie is stored only in your computer's working memory (RAM) and only lasts for your browsing session. When you close all your browser's windows, or when you shut down your computer, the session cookie disappears forever. A “persistent” cookie is stored on your computer's hard drive until a specified date, which could be tomorrow, next week, or 10 years from now. Persistent cookies stay on your computer until either a) they expire, b) they are overwritten with newer cookies, or c) you manually remove them. Most browsers can be configured not to accept cookies, however, this may prevent you from having access to some site functions or features. This site may use a third party to activate and/or deliver a service, or deliver site functionality such as fulfilling your request to purchase a product or service, including items from our online store. In performing this function the third party may place a persistent cookie on your computer or have to gather personal information from you in order to activate and deliver the service, or facilitate the processing of your purchase. This site may use a third-party click tracking analytics tool (such as DART, Omniture tags, DoubleClick, Efficient Frontier, Flurry and Google Analytics) to capture clickthrough statistics. ford.com may use spotlight ads/web beacons/GIF/pixel tags which are site instrumentation tools that help us to determine, for instance, whether a page has been viewed or not and, if so, how many times. Emails or electronic newsletters we send may use tools (e.g., pixel tags or web beacons) to gather email metrics and information to improve the reader’s experience such as how many of the emails are opened, if they were printed or forwarded, the type of device (e.g., mobile or PC) from which they were opened, and the city, state, and county associated with the applicable IP address. In general, any electronic image viewed as part of a webpage, including an ad banner, can act as a web beacon. When you visit our website the server housing the pages automatically generates a “session log.” We use session logs to help us determine how people travel through our site. In this way, we can structure our pages so that the information most frequently visited is easier to find. By tracking page visits, we can also determine if the information we're providing is being used. The only data gathered is the Internet Protocol (IP) address from which you came (which contains no personal information), the website that referred you, the pages you visited and the date and time of those visits. If you visit this site with an open ID, you may integrate with third-party social media sites, and ford.com may track on an aggregate level the number of visits to this site with an open ID, the number of items “liked” on this site, or items on this site that you choose to share with a third-party social media site. Users may be directed to ford.com via banner ads, site links or QR Codes. Ads, site links or QR Codes may use tools such as cookies or web beacons to deliver metrics on the effectiveness of the ads or links. They do not collect personal information from the user. Interest-Based/Online Behavioral Advertising Interest-Based/Online Behavioral Advertising. On some pages of our site we may allow third-party advertising partners to set web tracking tools (e.g., cookies and web beacons) to collect anonymous, non-personally identifiable information regarding your activities on those pages (e.g., your IP address, page(s) visited, time of day). We may also share such information we have collected with third-party advertising partners. These advertising partners may use this information (and similar information collected from other websites) for purposes of delivering future targeted advertisements to you when you visit other (non-Ford) sites within their networks. This practice is commonly referred to as “interest-based advertising” or “online behavioral advertising.” Pages of our website that collect information that may be used by such advertising partners for interest-based advertising purposes are identified by a link to AdChoices on the page. Opting out (site pages). If you do not want your browsing while on such pages to be used for interest-based advertising purposes, you may click on the AdChoices link to opt-out of such uses by the listed advertising partner(s). Even if you opt-out through this service, we may still collect non-personally identifiable information regarding your site activities and use it for non-interest-based advertising purposes as described in this privacy statement. Opting out (advertisements). Advertisements on third-party sites that contain the AdChoices link and that link to this privacy statement may have been directed to you based on anonymous, non-personally identifiable information collected by advertising partners over time and across websites. These advertisements provide a mechanism to opt-out of the advertising partners' use of this information for interest-based advertising purposes. Even if you opt-out through this service, we may still collect and use information from the advertisements for non-interest based advertising purposes, such as to determine the effectiveness of the advertisements. Opt-out Compliance Service. This site and advertisements on third-party sites that link to this privacy statement use the Evidon assurance service to comply with the cross-industry Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavioral Advertising managed by the Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA) ( http://www.aboutads.info ). When you opt-out on site pages or through such advertisements, Evidon conveys your opt-out election(s) to the applicable advertising partner(s), which then know to place a cookie on your specific computer and browser (and only the specific computer and browser from which you opt out) indicating that you have opted out.. If you clear your browser cookies and wish to remain opted out of interest-based advertising, you must opt-out again. The list of our advertising partners may be updated from time to time.

	sessionStorage.setItem("TRAIND", "Last Updated: June 20, 2013 Foursquare Labs, Inc. Privacy Policy Foursquare Labs, Inc. (Foursquare) knows that you take your privacy seriously. We do, too. We are committed to giving you transparency of our privacy practices and control over your data in connection with Foursquare's Service (as defined in Foursquare's Terms of Service). To that end, in addition to this Privacy Policy, we have developed the following other documents that complement and are part of this policy, all of which describe the data we collect, how we use it, with whom we share it, and your choices regarding your data: A 'Privacy 101’ page, a concise and easy to read way to learn about privacy on Foursquare® and the guiding principles that inform how we develop Foursquare and the decisions we make; and A set of FAQs related to privacy. This Privacy Policy covers Foursquare's treatment of personally identifiable information (Personal Information) and other data that Foursquare gathers when you are accessing Foursquare's Service. The Service is not available to individuals who are younger than 13 years old. What Personal Information Does Foursquare Collect? Personal Information You Provide to Us: We receive and store any information you enter on our Service or provide to us in any other way. The types of Personal Information collected may include your name, email address, phone number, birthday, Twitter and/or Facebook usernames, use information regarding your use of our Service, and browser information. We automatically receive your location when you use the Service. The Personal Information you provide is used for such purposes as allowing you to set up a user account and profile that can be used to interact with other users through the Service, improving the content of the Service, customizing the advertising and content you and your friends see, and communicating with you about specials and new features. We may also draw upon this Personal Information in order to adapt the Services of our community to your needs, to research the effectiveness of our network and Services, and to develop new tools for the community. Information Collected Automatically: When you use the Service, Foursquare automatically receives and records information on our server logs from your browser or mobile platform, including your location, IP address, cookie information, and the page you requested. We treat this data as non-Personal Information, except where we are required to do otherwise under applicable law. Unless otherwise stated in this Privacy Policy, Foursquare only uses this data in aggregate form. We may provide aggregate information to our partners about how our users, collectively, use our Service, so that our partners may also understand how often people use their services and our Service. Information We Receive from Third Parties: We receive and store information from third parties that interact in some way with the Service or that provide services to us in connection with the Service. For example, if you unlock a Foursquare special that is redeemed through a credit card swipe, the credit card processor may tell us information about the redemption such as the time that your card was swiped. In addition, you may choose to use apps that share your Personal Information, activities and/or content with Foursquare. Please read the privacy policy of any such app so that you understand its sharing practices. How is My Information Shared? Personal Information about our users is an integral part of our business. We neither rent nor sell your Personal Information to anyone, though, as described more fully in this section below (under Publicly Available Information, the Foursquare API, and Apps), your publicly-available information is available to third parties, and we may provide it to third parties, by license or otherwise. The default user settings for all data about you that is visible to others is summarized in our Privacy FAQs, together with information on how to change the default user settings or how to generally remove information, where applicable. Foursquare may share your Personal Information only as described in this Privacy Policy and related documents. Friends: Your friends can see, for example, the location and time of each of your check-ins, name, email, phone number, photo, hometown, mayorships and badges, links to your Twitter and Facebook accounts (if you have connected those accounts to your Foursquare account), a list of your friends, and tips you write. Individuals reading this information may use it or disclose it to other individuals or entities without our control and without your knowledge. We therefore urge you to think carefully about including any specific information you may deem private in comments or tips or other content (location or otherwise) that you create in the Service. Businesses, Locations, Events and Brands: One of the key purposes of Foursquare is to help users learn about businesses, locations, events and brands (for example, a TV show, a TV personality, newspaper or a consumer good that manages a page on the Service) that are relevant to them, and for these entities to provide information about themselves, their locations and events to users, as well as to reward users when they visit their location or event through offers and specials. When you check-in to a particular location that is a ‘claimed location’ your check-ins are shared with that location in order for it to better provide services to you. Additionally, brands may have access to aggregated and anonymous data, such as anonymized check-in data (that is, not tied to individual users) of users that like their brand. For more info read the Privacy FAQs. Publicly Available Information, the Foursquare API, and Apps: When you use Foursquare, certain information is public, such as your public user profile information, tips, likes, public photos, lists that you create and lists of friends, and may be searchable by search engines and be shared with or disclosed to third parties, including through our API to a wide range of users and services.  We may also share or disclose aggregated and anonymous data, such as anonymized check-in data (that is, not tied to individual users), to third parties, including users of our API, for analytical or other purposes.  In addition, use of third party apps developed using our API are subject to the terms of use and privacy policies of such third party developers. Certain Personal Information may be made available to third party developers if you or your friends use these third party apps. You should review the policies of third party apps and websites to ensure that you are comfortable with the ways in which they use and disclose the information you share with them. We do not guarantee that they will follow our rules or our Privacy Policy. Note that your friends will also be able to see which third party apps that you use. Agents: We employ other companies and people to perform tasks on our behalf and need to share your information with them to provide products or services to you. Our agents do not have any right to use Personal Information we share with them beyond what is necessary to assist us, and they provide a comparable level of protection for your Personal Information. Determining and Sharing Location Foursquare deals with location, so in order to work, Foursquare needs to know your location. Whenever you open and use/interact with the Foursquare app on your mobile device or go to Foursquare.com, we use the location information from your mobile device or browser (e.g., latitude and longitude) to tailor the Foursquare experience to your current location (i.e., we’ll show you a list of nearby locations, friends and tips). This information is NOT shared with others. Also, if you use Radar to receive notifications of tips/friends/etc., near you, the Foursquare app will, from time to time, tell us about your device’s location so that we can inform you of things of interest near you even if you are not directly interacting with the application. Your location data is ONLY shared with others when you proactively decide to check in to tell Foursquare you’re at a particular place or, if you have turned on ‘check-in by friends,’ when your friend mentions you in his or her check in. The location information shared with a check in is the location information of that place. Each of your Foursquare check-ins is saved to your Check-in History, which allows you to look back at all the locations you have checked in since you created your Foursquare account. You can delete any or all of your check-ins from the check-in details page on the Foursquare website and Foursquare app. If for some reason you ever decide to delete your Foursquare account, your entire check-in history will be removed from our database. Sometimes you’ll want to check in without sharing your specific whereabouts with friends. This is why we created Private check-ins -- a way of adding locations to your check-in history, earning points and adding to your badge counts, while maintaining complete privacy (even from friends). We find this comes in handy on dates, dinners with parents, or at a coffee shop when you’re just trying to get some work done - really anywhere where you don’t want friends to drop in. To check-in privately, simply select No on the Share this check-in with friends option seen on every check-in screen across our mobile apps. As noted above (under Publicly Available Information, Apps, and The Foursquare API), while your private check-ins will not be visible to the public or your friends, we may share the fact that such check-in has occurred in an anonymous manner. Foursquare Features The Foursquare service includes several features that may allow you to share your information with others. For each of these and our other features, the information available to friends and others, our default user settings, and how to alter the default settings, is available in the Privacy FAQs. Please review them carefully. Please remember that if you choose to provide personal information using certain features of the Service, that information may be available to the wider Foursquare community, or may be published on the Foursquare website, which is subject to indexing by third party search engines. Sharing with Partners, in connection with business transfers, and for the protection of Foursquare and others: Our Partners: In addition to the data sharing described above, we enter into relationships with a variety of businesses and work closely with them. In certain situations, these businesses, provide services to you, sell items or provide promotions to you through Foursquare's Service. In other situations, Foursquare provides services, or sells products jointly with these businesses. You can easily recognize when one of these businesses is associated with your transaction, and we will share your Personal Information that is related to such transactions with that business. Business Transfers: If Foursquare or substantially all of its assets are acquired, or in the unlikely event that Foursquare goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. Protection of Foursquare and Others: We may release Personal Information when we believe in good faith that release is necessary to comply with the law, including laws outside your country of residence; enforce or apply our conditions of use and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of Foursquare, our employees, our users, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations (including outside of your country of residence) for fraud protection and credit risk reduction. Email Communications If you do not want to receive commercial email or other mail from us, please indicate your preference during the registration process or by making a modification on your account settings page or through the 'settings' tab on our website once you're logged into the service. Please note that if you do not want to receive legal notices from us, such as notices regarding this Privacy Policy, those legal notices will still govern your use of the Foursquare Service, and you are responsible for reviewing such legal notices for changes. We may receive a confirmation when you open an email from Foursquare if your computer supports this type of program. Foursquare uses this confirmation to help us make emails more interesting and helpful and improve our service. What About Cookies and Similar Technologies? We and our agents use technologies like cookies, pixels, and local storage (like on your browser or device, which is similar to a cookie but holds more information) on our website, in our emails, and identifiers supplied by app platform companies within our apps to provide you with a range of products and services. You can control cookies through your browser settings and other tools. For more information, including the types of cookies and similar technologies found on Foursquare, please read Foursquare's 'Cookie Policy’. By continuing to use our Service through your computer or mobile device, you consent to our use of cookies, pixels and local storage in accordance with this Privacy Policy and Foursquare's Cookie Policy. We may work with advertisers or other partners and advertising service providers to serve ads or services to computers, mobile phones or other devices, which may use a cookie, pixel or other similar technology placed by Foursquare or the third party (although we would not share any other information that identifies you with an advertiser). This Privacy Policy and Foursquare's Cookie Policy covers the use of cookies by Foursquare and its service providers and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers. For information about how to opt out of receiving behavioral advertisements from our advertising partners, click here or click here. Is Personal Information About Me Secure? Your Foursquare account Personal Information is protected by a password for your privacy and security. You need to prevent unauthorized access to your account and Personal Information by selecting and protecting your password appropriately, and limiting access to your computer and browser by signing off after you have finished accessing your account. Foursquare endeavors to safeguard user information to ensure that user account information is kept private. However, Foursquare cannot guarantee the security of user account information. Unauthorized entry or use, hardware or software failure, and other factors, may compromise the security of user information at any time. The Service may contain links to other sites.

This Privacy Policy describes our practices in connection with information collected through services such as websites, mobile sites, applications (apps), and widgets (collectively, the Fox News Services). By using Fox News Services, you agree to the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy. As set forth in our Terms of Use, the Fox News Services are for a general audience, are not targeted to children, and do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13 years of age. This Privacy Policy applies to all users, including both those who use the Fox News Services without being registered with or subscribing to a Fox News Service and those who have registered with or subscribed to a Fox News Service. This Privacy Policy applies to Fox News's collection and use of your personal information (i.e., information that identifies a specific person, such as full name or email address). It also describes generally Fox News's practices for handling non-personal information (for example, interests, demographics and services usage). COLLECTION OF INFORMATION Fox News and our service providers collect the following information from and about you: Registration Information is the information you submit to register for a Fox News Service, for example, to create an account, post comments, receive a newsletter, or enter a contest or sweepstakes. Registration Information may include, for example, name, email address, gender, zip code and birthday. Public Information and Posts consist of comments or content that you post to the Fox News Services and the information about you that accompanies those posts or content, which may include a name, user name, comments, likes, status, profile information and picture. Public Information and Posts are always public, which means they are available to everyone and may be displayed in search results on external search engines. Information from Social Media. If you access or log-in to a Fox News Service through a social media service or connect a Fox News Service to a social media service, the information we collect may also include your user ID and/or user name associated with that social media service, any information or content you have permitted the social media service to share with us, such as your profile picture, email address or friends lists, and any information you have made public in connection with that social media service.

 	// Google Privacy Policy, http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/, retrieved 07/16/2013
	sessionStorage.setItem("TRAIND", " Privacy Policy Last modified: June 24, 2013 (view archived versions) There are many different ways you can use our services – to search for and share information, to communicate with other people or to create new content. When you share information with us, for example by creating a Google Account, we can make those services even better – to show you more relevant search results and ads, to help you connect with people or to make sharing with others quicker and easier. As you use our services, we want you to be clear how we’re using information and the ways in which you can protect your privacy. Our Privacy Policy explains: What information we collect and why we collect it. How we use that information. The choices we offer, including how to access and update information. We’ve tried to keep it as simple as possible, but if you’re not familiar with terms like cookies, IP addresses, pixel tags and browsers, then read about these key terms first. Your privacy matters to Google so whether you are new to Google or a long-time user, please do take the time to get to know our practices – and if you have any questions contact us. Information we collect We collect information to provide better services to all of our users – from figuring out basic stuff like which language you speak, to more complex things like which ads you’ll find most useful or the people who matter most to you online. We collect information in two ways: Information you give us. For example, many of our services require you to sign up for a Google Account. When you do, we’ll ask for personal information, like your name, email address, telephone number or credit card. If you want to take full advantage of the sharing features we offer, we might also ask you to create a publicly visible Google Profile, which may include your name and photo. Information we get from your use of our services. We may collect information about the services that you use and how you use them, like when you visit a website that uses our advertising services or you view and interact with our ads and content. This information includes: Device information We may collect device-specific information (such as your hardware model, operating system version, unique device identifiers, and mobile network information including phone number). Google may associate your device identifiers or phone number with your Google Account. Log information When you use our services or view content provided by Google, we may automatically collect and store certain information in server logs. This may include: details of how you used our service, such as your search queries. telephony log information like your phone number, calling-party number, forwarding numbers, time and date of calls, duration of calls, SMS routing information and types of calls. Internet protocol address. device event information such as crashes, system activity, hardware settings, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your request and referral URL. cookies that may uniquely identify your browser or your Google Account. Location information When you use a location-enabled Google service, we may collect and process information about your actual location, like GPS signals sent by a mobile device. We may also use various technologies to determine location, such as sensor data from your device that may, for example, provide information on nearby Wi-Fi access points and cell towers. Unique application numbers Certain services include a unique application number. This number and information about your installation (for example, the operating system type and application version number) may be sent to Google when you install or uninstall that service or when that service periodically contacts our servers, such as for automatic updates. Local storage We may collect and store information (including personal information) locally on your device using mechanisms such as browser web storage (including HTML 5) and application data caches. Cookies and anonymous identifiers We use various technologies to collect and store information when you visit a Google service, and this may include sending one or more cookies or anonymous identifiers to your device. We also use cookies and anonymous identifiers when you interact with services we offer to our partners, such as advertising services or Google features that may appear on other sites. How we use information we collect We use the information we collect from all of our services to provide, maintain, protect and improve them, to develop new ones, and to protect Google and our users. We also use this information to offer you tailored content – like giving you more relevant search results and ads. We may use the name you provide for your Google Profile across all of the services we offer that require a Google Account. In addition, we may replace past names associated with your Google Account so that you are represented consistently across all our services. If other users already have your email, or other information that identifies you, we may show them your publicly visible Google Profile information, such as your name and photo. When you contact Google, we may keep a record of your communication to help solve any issues you might be facing. We may use your email address to inform you about our services, such as letting you know about upcoming changes or improvements. We use information collected from cookies and other technologies, like pixel tags, to improve your user experience and the overall quality of our services. For example, by saving your language preferences, we’ll be able to have our services appear in the language you prefer. When showing you tailored ads, we will not associate a cookie or anonymous identifier with sensitive categories, such as those based on race, religion, sexual orientation or health. We may combine personal information from one service with information, including personal information, from other Google services – for example to make it easier to share things with people you know. We will not combine DoubleClick cookie information with personally identifiable information unless we have your opt-in consent. We will ask for your consent before using information for a purpose other than those that are set out in this Privacy Policy. Google processes personal information on our servers in many countries around the world. We may process your personal information on a server located outside the country where you live. Transparency and choice People have different privacy concerns. Our goal is to be clear about what information we collect, so that you can make meaningful choices about how it is used. For example, you can: Review and control certain types of information tied to your Google Account by using Google Dashboard. View and edit your ads preferences, such as which categories might interest you, using Ads Settings. You can also opt out of certain Google advertising services here. Use our editor to see and adjust how your Google Profile appears to particular individuals. Control who you share information with. Take information out of many of our services. You may also set your browser to block all cookies, including cookies associated with our services, or to indicate when a cookie is being set by us. However, it’s important to remember that many of our services may not function properly if your cookies are disabled. For example, we may not remember your language preferences. Information you share Many of our services let you share information with others. Remember that when you share information publicly, it may be indexable by search engines, including Google. Our services provide you with different options on sharing and removing your content. Accessing and updating your personal information Whenever you use our services, we aim to provide you with access to your personal information. If that information is wrong, we strive to give you ways to update it quickly or to delete it – unless we have to keep that information for legitimate business or legal purposes. When updating your personal information, we may ask you to verify your identity before we can act on your request. We may reject requests that are unreasonably repetitive, require disproportionate technical effort (for example, developing a new system or fundamentally changing an existing practice), risk the privacy of others, or would be extremely impractical (for instance, requests concerning information residing on backup tapes). Where we can provide information access and correction, we will do so for free, except where it would require a disproportionate effort. We aim to maintain our services in a manner that protects information from accidental or malicious destruction. Because of this, after you delete information from our services, we may not immediately delete residual copies from our active servers and may not remove information from our backup systems. Information we share We do not share personal information with companies, organizations and individuals outside of Google unless one of the following circumstances apply: With your consent We will share personal information with companies, organizations or individuals outside of Google when we have your consent to do so. We require opt-in consent for the sharing of any sensitive personal information. With domain administrators If your Google Account is managed for you by a domain administrator (for example, for Google Apps users) then your domain administrator and resellers who provide user support to your organization will have access to your Google Account information (including your email and other data). Your domain administrator may be able to: view statistics regarding your account, like statistics regarding applications you install. change your account password. suspend or terminate your account access. access or retain information stored as part of your account. receive your account information in order to satisfy applicable law, regulation, legal process or enforceable governmental request. restrict your ability to delete or edit information or privacy settings. Please refer to your domain administrator’s privacy policy for more information. For external processing We provide personal information to our affiliates or other trusted businesses or persons to process it for us, based on our instructions and in compliance with our Privacy Policy and any other appropriate confidentiality and security measures. For legal reasons We will share personal information with companies, organizations or individuals outside of Google if we have a good-faith belief that access, use, preservation or disclosure of the information is reasonably necessary to: meet any applicable law, regulation, legal process or enforceable governmental request. enforce applicable Terms of Service, including investigation of potential violations. detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues. protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of Google, our users or the public as required or permitted by law. We may share aggregated, non-personally identifiable information publicly and with our partners – like publishers, advertisers or connected sites. For example, we may share information publicly to show trends about the general use of our services. If Google is involved in a merger, acquisition or asset sale, we will continue to ensure the confidentiality of any personal information and give affected users notice before personal information is transferred or becomes subject to a different privacy policy. Information security We work hard to protect Google and our users from unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure or destruction of information we hold. In particular: We encrypt many of our services using SSL. We offer you two step verification when you access your Google Account, and a Safe Browsing feature in Google Chrome. We review our information collection, storage and processing practices, including physical security measures, to guard against unauthorized access to systems. We restrict access to personal information to Google employees, contractors and agents who need to know that information in order to process it for us, and who are subject to strict contractual confidentiality obligations and may be disciplined or terminated if they fail to meet these obligations. Application Our Privacy Policy applies to all of the services offered by Google Inc. and its affiliates, including services offered on other sites (such as our advertising services), but excludes services that have separate privacy policies that do not incorporate this Privacy Policy. Our Privacy Policy does not apply to services offered by other companies or individuals, including products or sites that may be displayed to you in search results, sites that may include Google services, or other sites linked from our services. Our Privacy Policy does not cover the information practices of other companies and organizations who advertise our services, and who may use cookies, pixel tags and other technologies to serve and offer relevant ads. Enforcement We regularly review our compliance with our Privacy Policy. We also adhere to several self regulatory frameworks. When we receive formal written complaints, we will contact the person who made the complaint to follow up. We work with the appropriate regulatory authorities, including local data protection authorities, to resolve any complaints regarding the transfer of personal data that we cannot resolve with our users directly. Changes Our Privacy Policy may change from time to time. We will not reduce your rights under this Privacy Policy without your explicit consent. We will post any privacy policy changes on this page and, if the changes are significant, we will provide a more prominent notice (including, for certain services, email notification of privacy policy changes). We will also keep prior versions of this Privacy Policy in an archive for your review.");

Generally speaking, we may collect the following information from or about you and your activities when you use the Hulu Services: information you give us, including your name, email address, birth date, gender, and -if you subscribe to Hulu Plus - your credit card information; information automatically collected when you use the Hulu Services, such as your location, your activity on the Hulu Services, and information collected via cookies, web beacons, or other technologies; information from other commercially available sources, such as data aggregators and public databases, or our business partners, which may include your interests, purchasing behavior and your activities online, such as websites visited and advertisements viewed; and if you connect your social networking account with your Hulu account, information from your social networking account as described below. We may combine all of the information we collect from or about you and use it in the manner described in this Privacy Policy.

Companies that provide services to us - including companies that assist with payment processing, website, user, and business analytics, data processing, account management, advertising, and other services - may collect information on the Hulu Services. However, our agreements with these service providers limit the types of information these companies collect, how they may collect it, and how they may use it. Other Websites and Platforms. The Hulu Services may be provided through Internet websites or other platforms operated by other companies. For example, you can access the Hulu Services currently on our partners’ websites and using Internet connected devices such as your Microsoft Xbox 360, Nintendo Wii, Roku Streaming Player, iPad or iPhone. Websites and platforms like these may be co-branded with our name or logo, but they are not operated or maintained by us, and we are not responsible for the privacy practices of the websites or platforms operated by third parties. If you are using the Hulu Services on another website or platform, you should check the privacy policy of the other website or platform to determine how it handles any information it collects from or about you. Social Networking Services. You can use the Hulu Services with social networking services, such as Facebook and connect your Hulu account with your social networking account. With your consent, Hulu may send information about you to these services, including information about your use of the Hulu Services. Social networking services also may collect certain technical information about you, such as the IP address of the device you are using to access the Hulu Services and the URL of the page you are viewing. For more information about how Hulu works with social networking services such as Facebook, please click here. Advertisers. Hulu places advertisements both on and off the Hulu Services and also carries advertisements from other companies, often with the ability to click through to websites or properties run by these other companies. Companies that help deliver these ads (including ad networks), and advertisers themselves, may use cookies, web beacons, and other technologies to collect information about your use of the Hulu Services in order to deliver advertisements to you, measure their effectiveness, and personalize advertising content. For more information about third-party advertising and Hulu, please click here. How does Hulu use information it collects from or about me? Payment Information. We only use payment information, such as credit card numbers, as necessary for completing a particular transaction or fulfilling a service (for example, processing payments from our Hulu Plus subscribers) and to prevent abuse of the Hulu Services.

Hulu's use of this information includes the following general purposes: contacting you; customizing the content and advertising you view; fulfilling your requests for products or services; identifying content you share when you use the Hulu Services; improving our services; conducting research; compiling aggregate data for internal and external business purposes; preventing potentially illegal activities; protecting our rights; other uses in accordance with our Terms of Use; and for any other purpose disclosed to you at the time we collect your information. Promotional Communications. We may use your information to: provide you with promotional information about Hulu's features, services, and other offerings that may be of interest to you; or provide information or offers to you that are related to the Hulu Services on behalf of Hulu's business partners. Information about your choices regarding promotional communications you receive from Hulu are described in the “Your Choices” section of this Privacy Policy. Recommendations and Advertising. We (and service providers acting on our behalf) may use information about you, including your use of Hulu, to provide recommendations and advertisements on the Hulu Services and elsewhere on the web. With whom does Hulu share the information it collects from or about me? Other Hulu Users. The Hulu Services include social features that let you interact with other people who use them. Information that you voluntarily make public on the Hulu Services will be shared with other Hulu users. For example, if your Hulu username includes your real name, when you post a comment it will be associated with your real name. You can control the sharing of certain information contained in your Hulu profile or about your activities on the Hulu Services with others on the Privacy and Settings page. Business Partners. Except when they are acting on our behalf or when you have provided your information as part of a co-branded promotion, we will obtain your consent before we share your contact information with advertisers, business partners, or other entities that are not affiliated with Hulu so that they may send you promotional information about their products and services directly. Social Networking Services. You can use the Hulu Services on other social networking services such as Facebook, and connect your Hulu account with your social networking account. With your consent, Hulu may send information about you to these social networking services, including information about the videos you watch and your activities on the Hulu Services. For more information about how Hulu works with social networking services such as Facebook, please click here. Service Providers. We may also share your information with companies that provide services to us, including companies that assist with payment processing, website, user, and business analytics, data processing, account management, advertising, and other services. Similarly, we may share your information with other people or entities in order to provide goods or services that you have requested or to complete a transaction at your request. We may also enter into agreements with outside companies that possess the technology that allows us to customize the advertising and marketing messages you receive while using the Hulu Services. Your information, including clickstream data about your use of the Hulu Services and other online activities, may be shared with these companies so this customization can be accomplished. However, our agreements with these service providers limit the types of information these companies collect, how they may collect it, and how they may use it. Other Parties When Required By Law or When Necessary to Protect Your Rights or Ours. There may be instances when we may disclose your information without providing you with a choice in order to protect the legal rights of Hulu or its affiliates, and each of their respective investors, directors, officers, employees, agents, and suppliers; to protect the safety and security of users of the Hulu Services or to enforce our Terms of Use; to protect against fraud or for risk management purposes; or to comply with or respond to the law or legal process or a request for cooperation by a government entity, whether or not legally required. If you notify us that you believe your legal rights have been violated by Hulu or another user of the Hulu Services, we may provide the information that you provide to us to others to the extent that we believe it is necessary to evaluate and respond to your complaint. For instance, if you submit a notice of copyright infringement to us, we may send a copy to the person or entity who uploaded, stored, or transmitted the material addressed by the communication. Other Parties In Connection With a Transfer of Assets. If we sell all or part of our business, or make a sale or transfer of assets, or are otherwise involved in a merger or business transfer, or in the unlikely event of bankruptcy, we may transfer your information to one or more third parties as part of that transaction. Other Parties With Your Consent. In addition to the sharing described in this Privacy Policy, and only with your consent, we may share personally identifiable information about you, for example, your name, address, telephone number, or email address, with other parties. How does Hulu use and share aggregate or non-personally identifiable information? In addition to the specific data use and sharing practices described in this Privacy Policy, we may use or share information collected through the Hulu Service for other purposes in aggregated or non-personally identifiable ways. This means that we will combine information about individuals together, or otherwise anonymize the information, so that no individual person is identifiable. We may use information in these forms for a variety of purposes, including for research or analysis, website administration, advertising, and promotional purposes. We also may share it with various affiliated and unaffiliated entities. For example, we may share aggregate information with advertisers about the volume of use on the Hulu Services, the specific Hulu videos in which users are most interested, and the effectiveness of advertisements viewed on the Hulu Services (as measured by the number of users who clicked on a particular advertisement). Also, we use independent third parties to help measure viewing of our content, and these third parties may report statistics about viewing in an aggregate or other non-personally identifiable form. Do I have choices about Hulu's use and sharing of the information it collects from or about me? You have choices about our use and sharing of certain information that we collect from or about you. Other Hulu Users. Hulu’s Privacy and Settings page gives you the option to control how certain information in your profile (other than your first and last name) and your activities are shared when you use the Hulu Services. Please note that when you choose to connect your Hulu account with a social networking account such as Facebook you may choose to share your information and activities with other users of Hulu and that particular social network. You can change your privacy settings at any time on the Privacy and Settings page. Business Partners: Except as otherwise described in this Privacy Policy, we will obtain your consent before we share your contact information with advertisers, business partners, or other entities not affiliated with Hulu so that they may send you promotional emails. We also may offer co-branded promotions with these business partners. If you request information about or otherwise interact with one of these promotions (such as by entering a contest), we may share your contact information with the business partners identified in the promotion. Social Networking Services. Hulu’s Privacy and Settings page allows you to control whether your profile information (other than your first and last name) and your activities on the Hulu Services are published to other social networks such as Facebook. Hulu’s Use of Your Information to Send You Promotional Materials. By visiting the Privacy and Settings page, you may opt out of receiving alerts or email updates from Hulu promoting our site or the products or services of our business partners, or notices about your queues or subscribed content. We updated these settings on November 19, 2010. If you affirmatively instructed us not to send you promotional materials prior to that date, we maintained that preference following the change. But if you didn’t give us an affirmative instruction and want to change your preference, you can do so on the Privacy and Settings page. Regardless of your choices with respect to promotional communications and updates regarding content, we may send you administrative messages, service announcements, terms and conditions of your account, or other similar communications, without offering you the opportunity to opt out of receiving them. Terminating Your Hulu Account. You may terminate your Hulu account, in accordance with our Terms of Use, via the link accessible on the Account page, or here. Hulu Plus subscribers should review our Terms of Use for our policies on cancellations and refunds. Please note that, if you terminate your account, we may retain some information about you. How does Hulu protect the information it collects from or about me? We use reasonable physical, technical, and administrative measures to safeguard information in our possession against loss, theft and unauthorized use, disclosure, or modification. For example, passwords and other sensitive information are encrypted in transit. We also take steps to ensure that only those Hulu employees, agents, and contractors who have a legitimate business reason to obtain access to your information are granted access. When you enter sensitive information (such as credit card information on our order forms), we encrypt that information using secure sockets layer technology (SSL), an industry standard protocol for billing transmission in order to help protect the financial information you send us. Despite these efforts, please note that no data transmission or storage can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. We want you to feel confident using the Hulu Services but we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us. Please refer to the U.S. Federal Trade Commission's website for information on how to protect yourself from identity theft. Does Hulu collect information from children under the age of 13? Hulu prohibits registration or subscription by, and will not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from, anyone under 13 years of age. Do any special considerations apply to visitors from outside the United States? Hulu is an online video service based in the U.S., and our offices are headquartered in the U.S. Please be aware that information you provide to us or that we obtain as a result of your use of the Hulu Services may be processed and transferred to the U.S. and be subject to U.S. law. The privacy and data protection laws in the U.S. may not be equivalent to such laws in your country of residence. By using our website, participating in any of the Hulu Services, or by providing us with your information, you consent to this collection, transfer, storage, and processing of information to and in the U.S. What happens when Hulu changes its Privacy Policy? From time to time, we may revise this Privacy Policy to reflect industry initiatives or changes in the law or changes to the scope of the Hulu Services or for other reasons. Therefore, it is important to check the effective date of the Privacy Policy posted at http://www.hulu.com/privacy each time you visit Hulu.com or use any of the Hulu Services to ensure you are familiar with the most updated policies and practices. If we make any material revisions to this Privacy Policy, we will notify you by posting notice on Hulu.com or by sending you an email to the email address you most recently provided to us prior to such revisions taking effect. If the material revisions concern practices where we have represented that we will obtain your consent to use or disclose your personally identifiable information, we will obtain your consent before taking any action inconsistent with those representations. What technologies are used to understand how people use the Hulu Services? On Hulu, we, along with our partners and vendors, use a variety of technologies to learn more about how people use the Hulu Services and the Internet. This section provides more information about some of those technologies and how they work. Cookies. Cookies are small bits of information that are stored in separate files within your computer's Internet browser. Cookies store information about your activities on a website or other platform. For example, cookies "
	+ "can store your session information for easy sign-in to a website or other platform you have previously visited. They enable us to make your use of the Hulu Services more enjoyable. For example, we, along with our partners and vendors, may display targeted advertisements based on your activities and other information about you that we have collected, such as your interests. Cookies are one way that we store this kind of information. We, along with our partners and vendors, may also use cookies and similar technologies to relate your use of the Hulu Services to information we obtain from you or from reputable third parties, and to compile aggregate data. For example, if you have asked us to send you information about our upcoming services or promotions, data about your activities on the Hulu Services, collected using cookies, may allow us to limit the materials we send you to items that we believe will be of interest to you. You can configure your Internet browser to warn you each time a cookie is being sent or to refuse cookies completely. However, unless you accept cookies, you will not have access to certain Hulu Services. Some advertisements displayed in connection with the Hulu Services may also access or place cookies on your Internet browser or use other technologies provided by third-party Internet advertisers and the companies that help them deliver their ads (sometimes called “ad networks” or “network advertisers”). For more information on this topic, please see our discussion of Third Party Advertising on Hulu. Other local storage. We, along with our partners and vendors, use other kinds of local storage, such as Local Shared Objects (also referred to as “Flash cookies”) and HTML5 local storage, in connection with the Hulu Services, including the video player. Sometimes called “browser cookies,” these technologies are similar to the cookies discussed above in that they are stored on your computers and can be used to store certain information about your activities and preferences, such as your volume/mute settings. However, these objects are stored in different parts of your computer from ordinary browser cookies. Many Internet browsers allow you to disable HTML5 local storage or delete information contained in HTML5 local storage using browser controls. For information about disabling or deleting information contained in Local Shared Objects, please click here. Please note that disabling these technologies may interfere with the performance and features of the video player. Web beacons. We, along with our partners and vendors, may also use technologies that communicate information from your Internet browser or the Hulu video player to a web server, including so-called “pixel tags,” “web beacons,” “clear GIFs,” or similar means (collectively, “Pixel Tags”). Pixel Tags, which can be embedded in web pages, videos, or emails, can allow a web server to read certain types of information from your browser, check whether you have viewed a particular web page or email message, and determine, among other things, the time and date on which you viewed the Pixel Tag, the IP address of your computer, and the URL of the web page from which the Pixel Tag was viewed. We use Pixel Tags to improve your Hulu experience, including to provide you with content customized to your interests. How does Hulu work with social networks such as Facebook? Hulu and Social Networking. If you choose to link your Hulu account with a social networking service, Hulu and that service may share certain information about you and your activities. With your consent, we also may share information about your activities, including what you watch on Hulu, with that social network’s users. Connecting with Facebook While Using the Hulu Services. Facebook and Hulu have developed a process that allows you to connect your Hulu account with your Facebook account. When you connect your accounts, you authorize Hulu and Facebook to share certain information about you with each other. With your consent, we may also share information about your activities on the Hulu Services with Facebook and its users including publishing your watch activity to Facebook. This section provides information on how this sharing works. Sharing on Facebook. If you connect your Hulu and Facebook accounts, Hulu will ask you if you want to automatically share information about your activities on the Hulu Services to Facebook. When you choose to share information about your activities on the Hulu Services with Facebook, Facebook may make that information visible to Facebook users in accordance with applicable law, the Facebook Data Use Policy, and your Facebook privacy settings. We recommend that you familiarize yourself with Facebook’s Data Use Policy and privacy controls. You can always stop or start sharing your activities on the Hulu Service with Facebook at any time using the Account > Privacy and Settings controls on Hulu. Sharing on Hulu. When you connect your Hulu and Facebook accounts, Hulu will access the list of all your Facebook friends and import them to Hulu. All of your Facebook friends who have also connected their Hulu and Facebook accounts will be connected to you on Hulu. Any Facebook friend who connects his or her Hulu and Facebook accounts at a later date will also automatically be connected to you on Hulu. This means that, if you choose to share your activities on the Hulu Services, all of your Facebook friends who have connected their Facebook and Hulu accounts will be able to see what you watch when they use Hulu. You can always stop or start sharing your activities on the Hulu Service at any time using the Account > Privacy and Settings controls on Hulu. Separate Lists of Friends. Although Hulu imports all of your friends from Facebook, the Hulu and Facebook privacy settings are separate. This means that your Facebook privacy controls do not control who can see your activity on Hulu. As a result, if you choose to connect your Facebook and Hulu accounts and enable sharing, then all of your Facebook friends will be able to see your Hulu activity when they use Hulu. Right now, the best way to stop sharing your activity on Hulu with a Facebook friend is to turn off social sharing or unfriend that person on Facebook. If you unfriend someone on Facebook there may be some reasonable delay, while Hulu and Facebook process changes to your Facebook friend list, before we update who can see your activity on Hulu. You can always review the current list of who can see your activity on Hulu using the Community controls. In addition, if you visit Hulu while logged into Facebook, then Facebook may be able to identify you and to associate the technical information provided by your web browser with other information that Facebook already has about you. How does third-party advertising on Hulu impact me? Hulu carries advertisements from other companies, often with the ability to click through to websites or properties run by these other companies. Clicking on or Viewing Ads. When you click on or view an advertisement, the advertiser may collect some information from or about you. Hulu is not responsible for the privacy practices of advertisers. You should check the privacy policy of the advertiser whose website you visit to determine how it handles any information it separately collects from you. Please be aware that Hulu does not warn you when you have chosen to click through to another website or property when using the Hulu Services. Use of Cookies in Third-Party Advertising. Companies that advertise on Hulu and the providers that help them deliver their ads may use cookies, web beacons, and other technologies to collect information about your use of the Hulu Services in order to deliver advertisements to you, measure their effectiveness, and personalize advertising content. The information practices of these advertising companies are governed by their own privacy policies and are not covered by this Privacy Policy. Information Shared with Advertisers and Advertising Companies. Hulu may share aggregate information with advertisers and the companies that help them deliver their ads so they can measure the effectiveness of advertisements viewed in connection with the Hulu Services. For example, we may tell advertisers the number of users who clicked on a particular advertisement. Opting Out of Third-Party Behavioral Advertising.

IMDb knows that you care how information about you is used and shared, and we appreciate your trust that we will do so carefully and sensibly. By visiting IMDb, you are accepting the practices described in this Privacy Notice. What Personal Information About Users Does IMDb Gather? The information we learn from users helps us personalize and continually improve your experience at IMDb. Here are the types of information we gather. Information You Give Us: We receive and store any information you enter on our Web site or give us in any other way. Click here to see examples of what we collect. You can choose not to provide certain information, but then you might not be able to take advantage of many of our features. We use the information that you provide for such purposes as responding to your requests, customizing future browsing for you, improving our site, and communicating with you. Automatic Information: We receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with us. For example, like many Web sites, we use cookies, and we obtain certain types of information when your Web browser accesses IMDb or advertisements and other content served by or on behalf of IMDb on other Web sites. Click here to see examples of the information we receive. E-mail Communications: To help us make e-mails more useful and interesting, we often receive a confirmation when you open e-mail from IMDb if your computer supports such capabilities. We also compare our user list to lists received from other companies, in an effort to avoid sending unnecessary messages to our users. If you do not want to receive e-mail or other mail from us, please use our User Administration pages to adjust your preferences. Information from Other Sources: We might receive information about you from other sources and add it to our account information. Click here to see examples of the information we receive. What About Cookies? Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer's hard drive through your Web browser to enable our systems to recognize your browser and to provide features such as My Movies, local show times, and browsing preferences. The help portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. Additionally, you can disable or delete similar data used by browser add-ons, such as Flash cookies, by changing the add-on's settings or visiting the Web site of its manufacturer. However, because cookies allow you to take full advantage of some of IMDb's essential features, we recommend that you leave them turned on. We use web beacons (also known as “action tags” or “single-pixel gifs”) and other technologies to measure the effectiveness of certain site features and to conduct research and analysis. We also allow third parties to place web beacons and other technologies on our site to conduct research and analysis, but we do not provide personal information to such third parties. Does IMDb Share the Information It Receives? Information about our users is an important part of our business, and we are not in the business of selling it to others. We share user information with our parent corporation (Amazon.com, Inc.), the subsidiaries it controls, and as described below. Affiliated Businesses We Do Not Control: We work closely with our affiliated businesses. In some cases, we will include offerings from these businesses on IMDb. In other cases, we may include joint offerings from IMDb and these businesses on IMDb. You can tell when another business is involved in the offering, and we share user information related to those offerings with that business. Agents: We employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Examples include sending e-mail, removing repetitive information from user lists, analyzing data, and providing marketing assistance. They have access to personal information needed to perform their functions, but may not use it for other purposes. Promotional Offers: Sometimes we send offers to selected groups of IMDb users on behalf of other businesses. When we do this, we do not give that business your name and e-mail address. If you do not want to receive such offers, please use our User Administration pages to adjust your preferences. Business Transfers: As we continue to develop our business, we might sell or buy additional services or business units. In such transactions, user information generally is transferred along with the rest of the service or business unit. Also, in the event that IMDb, Inc., or substantially all of its assets are acquired, user information will of course be included in the transaction. Protection of IMDb and Others: We release account and other personal information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with law; enforce or apply our Terms and Conditions of Use and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of IMDb, our users, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction. Obviously, however, this does not include selling, renting, sharing, or otherwise disclosing personally identifiable information from customers for commercial purposes in violation of the commitments set forth in this Privacy Notice. With Your Consent: Other than as set out above, you will always receive notice when information about you might go to third parties, and you will have an opportunity to choose not to share the information. What About Third-Party Advertisers? Our site includes third-party advertising and links to other websites. We do not provide any personally identifiable customer information to these advertisers or third-party websites. These third-party websites and advertisers, or Internet advertising companies working on their behalf, sometimes use technology to send (or serve) the advertisements that appear on our website directly to your browser. They automatically receive your IP address when this happens. They may also use cookies, JavaScript, web beacons (also known as action tags or single-pixel gifs), and other technologies to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to personalize advertising content. We do not have access to or control over cookies or other features that they may use, and the information practices of these advertisers and third-party websites are not covered by this Privacy Notice. Please contact them directly for more information about their privacy practices. In addition, the Network Advertising Initiative offers useful information about Internet advertising companies (also called ad networks or network advertisers), including information about how to opt-out of their information collection. IMDb also displays personalized third-party advertising based on personal information about users, such as information you submit to us about movies you own or have watched.  Click here for more information about the personal information that we gather. Although IMDb does not provide any personal information to advertisers, advertisers (including ad-serving companies) may assume that users who interact with or click on a personalized advertisement meet their criteria to personalize the ad (for example, users in the northwestern United States who bought, watched, or browsed for romantic comedies). If you do not want us to use personal information that we gather to allow third parties to personalize advertisements we display to you, please adjust your Advertising Preferences. How Secure Is Information About Me? If you use our subscription service, we work to protect the security of your subscription information during transmission by using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software, which encrypts information you input. It is important for you to protect against unauthorized access to your password and to your computer. Be sure to sign off when finished using a shared computer. What Choices and Access Do I Have? As discussed above, you can always choose not to provide information, even though it might be needed to take advantage of such IMDb features as My Movies and local show times. You can add or update certain information, such as your e-mail address, by using our User Administration pages. When you update information, we usually keep a copy of the prior version for our records. If you do not want to receive e-mail or other mail from us, please use our User Administration pages to adjust your preferences. (If you do not want to receive legal notices from us, such as this Privacy Notice, those notices will still govern your use of IMDb, and it is your responsibility to review them for changes.) If you do not want us to use personal information that we gather to allow third parties to personalize advertisements we display to you, please adjust your Advertising Preferences. The help portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. Additionally, you can disable or delete similar data used by browser add-ons, such as Flash cookies, by changing the add-on's settings or visiting the Web site of its manufacturer. However, because cookies allow you to take advantage of some of IMDb's essential features, we recommend that you leave them turned on. Children IMDb is not intended for use by children under the age of 13. If you are under 13, you may not submit information about yourself to IMDb. Conditions of Use, Notices, and Revisions If you choose to visit IMDb, your visit and any dispute over privacy is subject to this Notice and our Terms and Conditions of Use, including limitations on damages, resolution of disputes, and application of the law of the state of Washington. If you have any concern about privacy at IMDb, please send us a thorough description to our help desk, and we will try to resolve it. Our business changes constantly. This Notice and the Terms and Conditions of Use will change also, and use of information that we gather now is subject to the Privacy Notice in effect at the time of use. We may e-mail periodic reminders of our notices and conditions, unless you have instructed us not to, but you should check our Web site frequently to see recent changes. Unless stated otherwise, our current Privacy Notice applies to all information that we have about you and your account.  We stand behind the promises we make, however, and will never materially change our policies and practices to make them less protective of customer information collected in the past without the consent of affected customers.");

 	// Instagram Privacy Policy, http://instagram.com/about/legal/privacy/, retrieved 07/13/2013
	sessionStorage.setItem("TRAIND", "Privacy Policy Important Update In September 2012, we announced that Instagram had been acquired by Facebook. We knew that by teaming up with Facebook, we could build a better Instagram for you. Since then, we've been collaborating with Facebook's team on ways to do just that. As part of our new collaboration, we've learned that by being able to share insights and information with each other, we can build better experiences for our users. We're updating our Privacy Policy to highlight this new collaboration, but we want to make sure you understand that you still have control over who sees your photos. You still get to choose who can see your Instagram photos, and you still get to choose whether you post your photos on Facebook. So while we're looking forward to working closely with Facebook to build better experiences, we aren't changing the core features of the app that you've come to know and love. Our new Privacy Policy is effective on January 19, 2013. To learn about how we treat information collected prior to January 19, 2013, please click here. Privacy Policy Effective date: January 19, 2013 Welcome to Instagram (Instagram, we, us or our). Instagram provides a fast, beautiful and fun way for you to share media through our content-sharing platform. Just snap a photo, choose a filter to transform the look and feel, add comments (if you like) and share! Our Privacy Policy explains how we and some of the companies we work with collect, use, share and protect information in relation to our mobile services, web site, and any software provided on or in connection with Instagram services (collectively, the Service), and your choices about the collection and use of your information. By using our Service you understand and agree that we are providing a platform for you to post content, including photos, comments and other materials (User Content), to the Service and to share User Content publicly. This means that other Users may search for, see, use, or share any of your User Content that you make publicly available through the Service, consistent with the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Use (which can be found at http://instagram.com/legal/terms). Our Policy applies to all visitors, users, and others who access the Service (Users). Click on the links below to jump to each section of this Policy: Information We Collect How We Use Your Information Sharing of Your Information How We Store Your Information Your Choices About Your Information Children's Privacy Other Websites and Services How to Contact Us About a Deceased User How to Contact Us Changes to Our Privacy Policy 1. INFORMATION WE COLLECT We collect the following types of information. Information you provide us directly: Your username, password and e-mail address when you register for an Instagram account. Profile information that you provide for your user profile (e.g., first and last name, picture, phone number). This information allows us to help you or others be found on Instagram. User Content (e.g., photos, comments, and other materials) that you post to the Service. Communications between you and Instagram. For example, we may send you Service-related emails (e.g., account verification, changes/updates to features of the Service, technical and security notices). Note that you may not opt out of Service-related e-mails. Finding your friends on Instagram: If you choose, you can use our Find friends feature to locate other people with Instagram accounts either through (i) your contacts list, (ii) third-party social media sites or (iii) through a search of names and usernames on Instagram. If you choose to find your friends through (i) your device's contacts list, then Instagram will access your contacts list to determine whether or not someone associated with your contact is using Instagram. If you choose to find your friends through a (ii) third-party social media site, then you will be prompted to set up a link to the third-party service and you understand that any information that such service may provide to us will be governed by this Privacy Policy. If you choose to find your friends (iii) through a search of names or usernames on Instagram then simply type a name to search and we will perform a search on our Service. Note about Invite Friends feature: If you choose to invite someone to the Service through our Invite friends feature, you may select a person directly from the contacts list on your device and send a text or email from your personal account. You understand and agree that you are responsible for any charges that apply to communications sent from your device, and because this invitation is coming directly from your personal account, Instagram does not have access to or control this communication. Analytics information: We use third-party analytics tools to help us measure traffic and usage trends for the Service. These tools collect information sent by your device or our Service, including the web pages you visit, add-ons, and other information that assists us in improving the Service. We collect and use this analytics information with analytics information from other Users so that it cannot reasonably be used to identify any particular individual User. Cookies and similar technologies: When you visit the Service, we may use cookies and similar technologies like pixels, web beacons, and local storage to collect information about how you use Instagram and provide features to you. We may ask advertisers or other partners to serve ads or services to your devices, which may use cookies or similar technologies placed by us or the third party. More information is available in our About Cookies section Log file information: Log file information is automatically reported by your browser each time you make a request to access (i.e., visit) a web page or app. It can also be provided when the content of the webpage or app is downloaded to your browser or device. When you use our Service, our servers automatically record certain log file information, including your web request, Internet Protocol (IP) address, browser type, referring / exit pages and URLs, number of clicks and how you interact with links on the Service, domain names, landing pages, pages viewed, and other such information. We may also collect similar information from emails sent to our Users which then help us track which emails are opened and which links are clicked by recipients. The information allows for more accurate reporting and improvement of the Service. Device identifiers: When you use a mobile device like a tablet or phone to access our Service, we may access, collect, monitor, store on your device, and/or remotely store one or more device identifiers. Device identifiers are small data files or similar data structures stored on or associated with your mobile device, which uniquely identify your mobile device. A device identifier may be data stored in connection with the device hardware, data stored in connection with the device's operating system or other software, or data sent to the device by Instagram. A device identifier may deliver information to us or to a third party partner about how you browse and use the Service and may help us or others provide reports or personalized content and ads. Some features of the Service may not function properly if use or availability of device identifiers is impaired or disabled. Metadata: Metadata is usually technical data that is associated with User Content. For example, Metadata can describe how, when and by whom a piece of User Content was collected and how that content is formatted. Users can add or may have Metadata added to their User Content including a hashtag (e.g., to mark keywords when you post a photo), geotag (e.g., to mark your location to a photo), comments or other data. This makes your User Content more searchable by others and more interactive. If you geotag your photo or tag your photo using other's APIs then, your latitude and longitude will be stored with the photo and searchable (e.g., through a location or map feature) if your photo is made public by you in accordance with your privacy settings. 2. HOW WE USE YOUR INFORMATION In addition to some of the specific uses of information we describe in this Privacy Policy, we may use information that we receive to: help you efficiently access your information after you sign in remember information so you will not have to re-enter it during your visit or the next time you visit the Service; provide personalized content and information to you and others, which could include online ads or other forms of marketing provide, improve, test, and monitor the effectiveness of our Service develop and test new products and features monitor metrics such as total number of visitors, traffic, and demographic patterns diagnose or fix technology problems automatically update the Instagram application on your device Instagram or other Users may run contests, special offers or other events or activities (Events) on the Service. If you do not want to participate in an Event, do not use the particular Metadata (i.e. hashtag or geotag) associated with that Event. 3. SHARING OF YOUR INFORMATION We will not rent or sell your information to third parties outside Instagram (or the group of companies of which Instagram is a part) without your consent, except as noted in this Policy. Parties with whom we may share your information: We may share User Content and your information (including but not limited to, information from cookies, log files, device identifiers, location data, and usage data) with businesses that are legally part of the same group of companies that Instagram is part of, or that become part of that group (Affiliates). Affiliates may use this information to help provide, understand, and improve the Service (including by providing analytics) and Affiliates' own services (including by providing you with better and more relevant experiences). But these Affiliates will honor the choices you make about who can see your photos. We also may share your information as well as information from tools like cookies, log files, and device identifiers and location data, with third-party organizations that help us provide the Service to you (Service Providers). Our Service Providers will be given access to your information as is reasonably necessary to provide the Service under reasonable confidentiality terms.

This information would allow third-party ad networks to, among other things, deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you.

We may also combine your information with other information in a way that it is no longer associated with you and share that aggregated information.

 	// LEGO Group Privacy Policy, http://aboutus.lego.com/en-us/legal-notice/privacy-policy-full/, retrieved 07/11/2013
	sessionStorage.setItem("TRAIND", "Published : 17 February 2012, 09:43 CET Privacy Policy Table of contents: This document contains the privacy policy of the LEGO Group. Please feel free to browse the policy. If you are looking for specific information, you may use the following links, which will take you directly to individual sections of this policy. Introduction General principles Transfer of personal data to third parties and/or other countries Personal data collected online from children under the age of 13 Processing of personal data through LEGO® channels Cookies Review and update of personal data Data security Miscellaneous Introduction This policy governs any kind of processing (including collection, use, transfer, storage and deletion) of personally identifiable information (any information that may be used to identify a physical person, and any other information associated therewith) about natural persons, which are either consumers of LEGO® products or services, or representatives of our cooperation partners (“personal data”), by all business units and entities within the LEGO Group. This policy applies to our processing of personal data collected through any means, actively as well as passively, online as well as offline, from persons located anywhere in the world. Any question regarding our processing of personal data may be directed to: LEGO SYSTEM A/S Aastvej 1, DK-7190 Billund Denmark Attn: Privacy Officer or to the company within the LEGO group of companies closest to you. LEGO entities General principles Generally, the LEGO Group will be guided by the following principles when processing personal data: 1. We will only collect personal data for specific and specified purposes; 2. We will not collect personal data beyond what is necessary to accomplish those purposes; 3. We will not use personal data for purposes other than that for which the data was collected, except as stated herein, or with prior consent; 4. We will not transfer personal data to third parties or across borders, except as stated herein, or with prior consent; 5. We will seek to verify and/or update personal data periodically, and we will accept requests for amendments of personal data; 6. We will apply high technical standards to make our processing of personal data secure; 7. Except when stated herein, we will not store personal data in identifiable form longer than is necessary to accomplish its purpose, or as is required by law. The LEGO Group encourages families to visit our LEGO.com sites together as a shared activity. Transfer of personal data to third parties and/or other countries As a general principle, we process personal data in order to facilitate or improve the LEGO Group’s offerings and services to you. We do purchase supplementary data from public sources to complement our data bases. We do not process personal data on behalf of third parties, nor do we sell personal data to, or share personal data with, third parties for their own, independent use, except if you allow us to do so (see LEGO Shop at Home below). We do share personal data with third party vendors when it is necessary to provide services that we don’t perform ourselves, e.g. shipping of LEGO® products, mailing of LEGO® Club Magazines, etc. We also use third party data hosting companies to store personal data collected by us in their servers, and to do data validation checks for us (see LEGO ID - Linked Accounts below). We undertake or commission consumer research projects from time to time and we may share personal data with third party research companies for this purpose. Also, such third party research companies may host survey data in their data bases on our behalf. All data transfers to third party vendors or partners, including those listed as examples above will be subject to a written contract between us and the third party vendor or partner in question, and the vendor or partner will not have any authority to use such personal data for any purpose other than as instructed by us. When relevant, personal information may be shared among the business units and entities inside the LEGO Group. LEGO entities We will disclose personal data when legally obligated to do so under subpoena or court order, or for law enforcement purposes. For operational security reasons, we process (mirror) personal data in Europe and the United States. This means that all personal data processed by us is transferred between our facilities in Europe and the United States periodically. Personal data collected online from children under the age of 13 When a child under the age of 13 (or such higher age as may be determined by local law; in the following, the age 13 is used as the common denominator for easy reference) contacts the LEGO Group online, for example to participate in a contest or to ask a question, we will collect that child's email address and the e-mail address of the child's parent or guardian. We will use the child's e-mail address only for the purpose for which it was collected, and we will use the e-mail address of the parents or guardians only to provide notification about the child's contact with us, and to provide notification of the types and uses of personal data collected, if and as required by law. As a parent or guardian of a child under the age of 13 from whom we have collected personal data, you have the right to review and have deleted such personal data, and to refuse to permit further collection or use of such personal data. To do so, you should contact us by clicking here Parents and guardians who wish to review personal data concerning their children will be required to specify the usernames and passwords of the children concerned, and to provide their own e-mail address for verification and contact purposes. We cannot and will not establish conditions that will require or encourage children to disclose personal data over and above what is reasonably necessary to participate in any activity features on our web sites. Children under 13 years of age are allowed to participate in contests. However, if such a child wins, notification will be sent to the parent or guardian's e-mail address (provided by the child when he/she enters the contest). Also, we will not ask the child for any personal data beyond e-mail addresses without obtaining prior parental consent. Any personal data obtained from children and parents during contests will be kept until the contest ends and prizes are delivered, and then it will be deleted. If any online activity offered by us will allow children under the age of 13 to reveal personal data publicly (for example via un-moderated chat rooms or bulletin boards), we will obtain parental consent before allowing the child to participate. Currently, all such activities are moderated, monitored and/or screened. Processing of personal data through LEGO® channels LEGO ID General: We have introduced one common profile platform (LEGO ID) which is usable across different LEGO online applications. When you have created one LEGO ID for one application, it can be used for other applications as well. A LEGO ID may be created by children and adults alike, but where an individual younger than 13 signs-up, we will, as a general rule, collect personal data from the parents or legal guardian of the child rather than the child. In order to create a LEGO ID, we will process personal data such as email address (and a parent or legal guardian email address if the creator is under the age of 13), birthday, country of residence, and gender. We will also require a password and a username to be created. The email address is used for sending account notifications and other system-related information as needed. Linked Accounts: By linking children’s LEGO ID’s with parents or legal guardians LEGO ID’s, we enable more substantial parental control over the child’s online activities (e.g. in regards to the LEGO Universe game). In doing so, however, it is extremely important that we can verify the relationship between the child and the parent or legal guardian to whose LEGO ID the child’s LEGO ID is to be linked. For this reason, we will process personal data in regards to the parent or legal guardian such as first and last name, mailing address, date of birth and a more reliable type of offline ID number (e.g. driver’s license number or social security number, personal identification number or the like) varying by jurisdiction. We will transfer these data to an external service provider, which will perform the validation for us. Validation services will be performed under a written contract between us and the service provider. We will not store personal data collected for the validation in our archives. The result we receive back will be a “match” (in which case the child and the parent or legal guardian LEGO ID’s will be linked) or a “no match” (in which case the LEGO ID’s will not be linked, until and unless an appropriate relationship between the child and the applicant has been established otherwise). The external service provider will process and store the personal data submitted by us strictly for documentation purposes. LEGO Shop at Home When you use our LEGO Shop at Home service online or offline (e.g. ordering online via shop.LEGO.com or via the LEGO Consumer Services Center, via catalogue or otherwise), we will process transaction-related personal data, such as your first and last name, mailing and shipping address, phone number, email address, credit card or other payment information, and (if you have created a [LEGO ID]) your date of birth and gender. We will also process information about your purchases with us. We will use such personal data to process and deliver your order, to provide notification of order status, and to update your profile periodically to ensure that we have the most accurate personal data available. We will also use said personal data to analyze customer behavior and to customize our LEGO Shop at Home communication with you, if applicable. In this respect, we may transfer tracking information about your use of our sites to external service providers, which will help us optimize your browsing experience. Optimization services will be performed under a written contract between us and any service provider. If you opt-in (or upon request), we will send you LEGO Shop at Home promotional and marketing emails. These may be targeted to you based on your purchase history or online browsing behaviour. You may allow us to share your name, address and ordering activity with carefully selected third parties in whose products we believe you might be interested. LEGO VIP Program: If you are 13 years or older (age limitation may vary by country), you can join our LEGO VIP Program in physical LEGO Brand Retail Stores, online via LEGO Shop at Home, by phone via the LEGO Consumer Services Center, or through LEGO events offered by the VIP program. If you sign up in a store or by phone, you will be required to subsequently visit VIP.LEGO.com/Register to finalize the sign-up process online. We will process personal data such as your first and last name, address details, phone number, cell phone number (optional), email address, credit card or other payment information, LEGO ID username and password, date of birth and gender. We will also process information about your purchases with us (online and offline), marketing preferences and your use of LEGO.com related websites. We use your personal data to send you regular email newsletters, to send you marketing offers (if you opt-in) via catalogues, emails and text messages, to analyze customer behavior and to customize our LEGO VIP Program communication with you. We will also use your personal data to update your profile periodically to ensure that we have the most accurate personal data available. LEGO Club Children can join the LEGO Club. If the child is under the age of 13, we will, as a general rule, collect personal data relevant to the membership from the parents or legal guardian of the child rather than the child. Where the only personal data needed is the email address of the child (e.g. for participation in a contest), we may collect the email address directly from the child, and provide notification to the parents or legal guardian as required by law. As a member of one of the LEGO Club, the child may receive periodical LEGO Club Magazines, LEGO Club email newsletters, and be able to participate in contests, etc. When completing a LEGO Club membership application, you consent to the LEGO Club using your child’s information for mailings and emails. The data will be used only for LEGO mailings and will not be sold, rented, or otherwise disclosed to any company outside the LEGO Company except for companies acting as our agents to help us provide services requested by the child. We will process personal data such as the child’s first and last name, mailing address, gender, date of birth, email address and phone number, as relevant. LEGO Consumer Service You may contact our LEGO Consumer Service Center with questions or comments related to the LEGO Group, and our products and services. You may also request replacement parts for your LEGO® sets, request catalogues, etc. When you contact us, we will process personal data such as age group, your email address, your gender, first and last name, mailing address, phone and/or cell phone number, as relevant. LEGO Universe LEGO Universe is a subscription based application. If a [LEGO ID]has not been created previously, we will process personal data such as email address (and a parent or legal guardian email address if the creator is under the age of 13), birthday, country of residence, and gender. We will also require a password and a username to be created. In order to support billing and customer notification processes, we will process personal data such as your first and last name, mailing address, credit card or other payment information, and email address. We will also process information about your LEGO Universe purchases. Cookies We use cookies on our websites. Cookies are small data files that your browser places on your computer or device.

To better protect your privacy we provide this notice explaining our online information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used. To make this notice easy to find, we make it available on LexisNexis home page and at every point where personally identifiable information may be requested. This notice applies to all information collected from or submitted to the LexisNexis Group (LNG) Web sites, but to make this notice easier to read we will use the term our Web site, which includes lexisnexis.com, lexis.com®, nexis.comSM, lexisONE.com®. You may have also been directed to this Privacy Statement from other web sites owned or operated by LNG that have adopted this policy.   Other LNG Web sites may operate under their own privacy notices such as the lexisnexis.com/risk online privacy policy for www.lexisnexis.com/risk and affiliated hypersites. Our Web site contains links to other Web sites operated by third parties. LNG is not responsible for the privacy practices or policies of such third party web sites and this Notice does not apply to those Web sites. Application of This Notice This Notice applies only to the information collected by LNG from the users of our Web site. It does not apply to information collected by LNG in any other way, including offline. The Information We Collect Our Web site is not set up to automatically collect personally identifiable information from each visitor to our Web site. It does recognize the home server of visitors, but not email addresses. For example, we can tell which Internet Service Provider our visitors use, but not the names, addresses or other information about our visitors that would allow us to identify the particular visitors to our Web site. This information is used only for internal purposes by our technical support staff. Our Web site does track certain information about the visits to our Web site. For example, we compile statistics that show the numbers and frequency of visitors to our Web site and its individual pages. These aggregated statistics are used internally to improve our Web site and for product development and marketing purposes generally. Those aggregated statistics may also be provided to advertisers and other third parties, but again, the statistics contain no personal information and cannot be used to gather such information. In a few areas on our Web site, we ask you to provide information that will enable us to verify whether you are entitled to access and use certain information, materials and services available from our Web site, or to enable us to enhance your site visit, to assist you with customer service or technical support issues, or to follow up with you after your visit, or to otherwise support your customer relationship with LNG. It is completely optional for you to participate. However, failure to participate may mean that you cannot access and use certain information, materials and services. For example, we request information from you when you: Log on to certain areas of our Web site, such as the lexis.com® Research System, where you may be prompted to provide us with your LexisNexis® ID number and password as a condition to gaining access to certain information, materials or services Register or sign up to use a service such as lexisONE.com® Subscribe to a newsletter or desire to be added to our mailing lists for other products or services Place an order Participate in a sweepstakes or other promotional offer Provide feedback in an online survey.

On occasion, we may ask for additional information to enable us to provide you with access to and use of certain information, materials and services. In the case of newsletters or mailing lists, you will be able to unsubscribe to these mailings at any time. How We Use Information: LNG Only Uses Your Personal Information for Specific Purposes The personal information you provide to us when using our Web site, such as your name, postal or email address or telephone number will be kept confidential and used to support your customer relationship with LNG, and to notify you of special offers, updated information and new products and services from LNG, offers from third parties that we think may be of interest to you, or used by LNG or third parties for the purpose of conducting market research or surveys on behalf of LNG. Agents or contractors of LNG who are given access to your personal information will be required to keep the information confidential and not use it for any other purpose than to carry out the services they are performing for LNG. LNG may enhance or merge your information collected at its Web site with data from third parties for purposes of marketing products or services to you. With respect to network advertising companies (companies that manage and provide advertising for numerous unrelated companies), to the extent that LNG utilizes such advertising companies to provide advertisements on our Web site, LNG may provide them with your log-in name and any demographic information about you that we collect. Those advertising companies may combine that data with non-personally identifiable data collected by the advertising company from your computer solely for the purpose of delivering on our Web site advertisements that are targeted to you. Circumstances may arise where we are required to disclose your personal information to third parties for purposes other than to support your customer relationship with LNG, such as in connection with a corporate divestiture or dissolution where we sell all or a portion of our business or assets (including our associated customer lists containing your personal information), or if disclosure is required by law or is pertinent to judicial or governmental investigations or proceedings. You Can Opt Out of Receiving Further Marketing from LNG at Any Time We will send you information about our various products and services, or other products and services we feel may be of interest to you. Only LNG (or agents or contractors working on behalf of LNG and under confidentiality agreements) will send you these direct mailings.

You can list honors, awards, professional affiliations, LinkedIn Group memberships, networking objectives, companies or individuals that you follow, and other information. With your approval, your connections may provide recommendations and endorsements of you. Providing additional information enables you to derive more benefit from LinkedIn by helping you express your professional identity; find other professionals, opportunities, and information; and help recruiters find you. It also enables us to serve you ads and other relevant content on and off LinkedIn. We collect information when you sync non-LinkedIn content – like your email address book, mobile device contacts, or calendar – with your account. We use this information to improve your experience. You can remove your address book and any other synced information whenever you'd like. D. Address Book, LinkedIn Contacts, and Other Services That Sync with LinkedIn You may use the LinkedIn contacts importer to upload individual contacts or your entire address book into LinkedIn. LinkedIn stores this information and uses it to help you manage it with “LinkedIn Contacts,” which can be your primary resource for storing, organizing, and utilizing your contact information. LinkedIn also uses this information to help you grow your LinkedIn network by: identifying your contacts already on LinkedIn; providing a template to send invitations to your contacts that have not registered with LinkedIn; and suggesting people you may know who are already Members of LinkedIn but who may not be in your LinkedIn Contacts. Please note that when you send an invitation to connect to another individual (a “connection”), that person will have access to your email address because it is displayed in the invitation. LinkedIn will also remind you of pending invitations. Your LinkedIn connections will also have access to your email address. LinkedIn makes other tools available to sync information with LinkedIn, and may also develop additional features that allow members to use their LinkedIn account in conjunction with other third-party services. For example, LinkedIn’s iPad and iPhone applications allow you to sync your device’s calendar with LinkedIn to show you the LinkedIn profiles of meeting attendees. Another example is Rapportive, which allows you to see LinkedIn and other public social media information about the people you email. If you grant these products (mobile applications, Rapportive, or other LinkedIn applications that sync external email services) permission to access your email accounts, they will access your email header information in order to match it to LinkedIn and other public social media profiles. LinkedIn’s products that sync with external email services will also temporarily cache message content for performance reasons; however, the cached message content will be temporarily cached in a way that is unreadable by LinkedIn and its service providers. Any information that you upload or sync with LinkedIn is covered by the User Agreement and this Privacy Policy. You can remove your information at your convenience using the features LinkedIn makes available or in accordance with Section 3.	We collect information when you sync non-LinkedIn content—like your email address book, mobile device contacts, or calendar—with your account. We use this information to improve your experience. You can remove your address book and any other synced information at any time. When you contact our Help Center, we collect information to respond to your questions and better serve you. E. Customer Service When you contact LinkedIn’s Help Center, we collect information that helps us categorize your question, respond to it, and, if applicable, investigate any breach of our User Agreement or this Privacy Policy. We also use this information to track potential problems and trends and customize our support responses to better serve you. We collect information when you visit LinkedIn, use our mobile applications, and interact with advertising on LinkedIn. F. Using the LinkedIn Site and Applications We collect information when you use the LinkedIn website, LinkedIn applications (for example, LinkedIn for iPhone or Android), and LinkedIn platform technology (such as “Share on LinkedIn” plugins for publishers). For example, we collect information when you view or click on ads, import your address book, join and participate in groups, participate in polls, install a LinkedIn mobile application, and share articles on LinkedIn. We collect information when you use your LinkedIn account to sign in to other sites or services, and when you view web pages that include LinkedIn plugins. You can opt out of our collection of plugin impressions anytime. G. Using Third-Party Services and Visiting Third-Party Sites We receive information when you use your LinkedIn account to log in to a third-party website or application. Also, when you visit a third-party site that embeds LinkedIn professional plugins (such as “Share on LinkedIn” for publishers) we receive information that those pages have loaded in your web browser. If you are logged in as a LinkedIn Member when you visit sites with LinkedIn plugins, we use this information to recommend tailored content to you. LinkedIn will use this information to personalize the LinkedIn-provided functionality on third-party sites, including providing you insights from your LinkedIn network and allowing you to share information with your network (1st and 2nd degree connection on LinkedIn). Users wishing to disable this personalization may opt out here. LinkedIn’s retention of this data is addressed in Section 3.B. We do not use this information for advertising. LinkedIn may provide reports containing aggregated impression information to companies hosting LinkedIn plugins and similar technologies to help them measure LinkedIn-generated traffic to their websites. You can opt out of LinkedIn using your impression data by clicking here. We use cookies to help personalize your LinkedIn experience and show you relevant ads. H. Cookies We use cookies and similar technologies, including mobile device identifiers, to help us recognize you, improve your LinkedIn experience, increase security, measure use of our Services, and serve advertising. You can control cookies through your browser settings and other tools. For more information, including the types of cookies found on LinkedIn, please read LinkedIn’s Cookie Policy. By visiting LinkedIn, you consent to the placement of cookies and beacons in your browser in accordance with this Privacy Policy and LinkedIn’s Cookie Policy. We target ads to you on and off LinkedIn, based on information you included in your profile and your use of LinkedIn. We give you a number of ways to opt out of these ads, including through the Ad Choices icon shown with any LinkedIn ads on third-party sites. If you do not want to receive LinkedIn ads on third-party sites, you can opt out. I. Advertising Technologies and Web Beacons We target ads to Members both on and off LinkedIn through a variety of ad networks and ad exchanges, using: Advertising technologies like web beacons, pixels, ad tags, cookies, and mobile identifiers as permitted by mobile platforms; Member-provided profile information and categories (for example, “product managers in Texas”); Information inferred from a Member’s profile (for example, using job titles to infer age, industry, seniority, and compensation bracket; or names to infer gender). Your use of LinkedIn (for example, your LinkedIn search history) or clicking on a LinkedIn ad. Information from advertising partners which we use to help deliver ads more relevant to you. We do not share personally identifiable information with any third-party advertiser or ad network, although your profile is visible to other LinkedIn Members and through public search depending on your settings. LinkedIn may show you sponsored content in your Network Update Stream (NUS), which will be designated as sponsored content and will behave like other NUS updates. If you take social action (for example, if you “like or “comment” on the sponsored content), your action will be seen by your network and other LinkedIn Members who are shown the sponsored content after you have acted on it. LinkedIn ads that are delivered on third-party sites contain the label “Ads by LinkedIn.” You may opt out of these ads served to you on third-party sites here. The Ad Choices icon shows you that we adhere to the Digital Advertising Alliance’s self-regulatory principles for online behavioral advertising. Please see http://www.aboutads.info for details. We collect information from the devices and networks that you use to access LinkedIn. This information helps us improve and secure our Services. J. Log Files, IP Addresses, and Information About Your Computer and Mobile Device When you visit or leave LinkedIn by clicking a hyperlink or view a plugin on a third-party site, we automatically receive the URL of the site from which you came or the one to which you are directed. Also, advertisers receive the URL of the page that you are on when you click an ad on LinkedIn. We also receive the internet protocol (“IP”) address of your computer or the proxy server that you use to access the web, your computer operating system, your type of web browser, your mobile device (including your mobile device identifier provided by your mobile device operating system), your mobile operating system (if you are accessing LinkedIn using a mobile device), and the name of your ISP or your mobile carrier. We may also receive location data passed to us from third-party services or GPS-enabled devices that you have set up, which we use to show you local information (for example, weather information) on our iPad application. We are constantly innovating to improve our Services, which means we may create new ways to collect information on the Service. K. Other LinkedIn is a dynamic, innovative environment, which means we are always seeking to improve the services we offer you. We often introduce new features, some of which may result in the collection of new information (for example, when the Endorsements feature launched, we began collecting information about skills for which Members were endorsed and the individuals who endorsed them). Furthermore, new partnerships or corporate acquisitions may result in new features, and we may potentially collect new types of information. Back to Top 2. How we use your personal information At LinkedIn, we take pride in our mantra of “Members first,” which means that above all else we strive to use your information to provide you world-class services in a professional and trustworthy manner. When you join LinkedIn, you acknowledge that information you provide on your profile can be seen by others and used by us as described in this Privacy Policy and our User Agreement. A. Consent to LinkedIn Processing Information About You The personal information you provide to us may reveal or allow others to identify aspects of your life that are not expressly stated on your profile (for example, your picture or your name may reveal your gender). By providing personal information to us when you create or update your account and profile, you are expressly and voluntarily accepting the terms and conditions of LinkedIn’s User Agreement and freely accepting and agreeing to our processing of your personal information in ways set out by this Privacy Policy. Supplying information to us, including any information deemed “sensitive” by applicable law, is entirely voluntary on your part. You have the right to withdraw or modify your consent to LinkedIn’s collection and processing of the information you provide at any time, in accordance with the terms of this Privacy Policy and the User Agreement, by changing your Settings or by closing your account. We communicate with you using LinkedIn messaging, email, and other ways available to us. We may send you messages relating to the availability of the Services, security, or other service-related issues. We also may send promotional InMail messages to your LinkedIn inbox. You can change your email settings at any time. B. LinkedIn Communications We communicate with you through email, notices posted on the LinkedIn website, messages to your LinkedIn inbox, and other means available through the Service, including mobile text messages and push notifications. Examples of these messages include: (1) welcome and engagement messages - when you register on LinkedIn, we may send you a series of emails to inform you about how to best use LinkedIn as well as new features; (2) service messages – these will cover service availability, security, and other issues about the functioning of LinkedIn; (3) promotional messages – these include both email and InMail messages (InMail messages are only delivered to your LinkedIn InBox), and may contain promotional information directly or on behalf of our partners, including job opportunities and information from companies that are hiring. These messages will be sent to you based on your profile information and messaging preferences. LinkedIn tracks the open rate of your InMails to provide your InMail acceptance score. You may change your email and contact preferences at any time by signing into your account and changing your email settings. You can also opt out of promotional messages by sending a request to LinkedIn Help Center. Please be aware that you cannot opt out of receiving service messages from LinkedIn. With certain communications you send on LinkedIn, the recipient can see your name, email address, and some network information. C. User Communications Many communications that you initiate through LinkedIn (for example, an invitation sent to a non-Member) "
	+ "will list your name and primary email address in the header of the message. Messages you initiate may also provide the recipient with aggregate information about your network (for example, how many people are in your network). Other communications that you initiate through the Services, like a request for an introduction, will list your name as the initiator but will not include your personal email address contact information. Once you have connected with an individual, regardless of who sent the invitation, your contact information will be shared with that individual. We use the information you provide on your profile to customize your experience on LinkedIn. D. Customized Content We use information that you provide to us to customize your experience and the experiences of others on LinkedIn. For example, when you sign in to your account, we may display the names of new Members who have recently joined your network or recent updates from your connections and companies you follow. We also use aggregated information from your network to show you content, such as news relevant to you, your industry, or your profession. E. Sharing Information with Affiliates We may share your personal information with our LinkedIn affiliates outside of the LinkedIn entity that is your data controller (for example, LinkedIn Corporation may share your information with LinkedIn Ireland Limited) as necessary to provide the Services. By agreeing to this Privacy Policy, you are consenting to this sharing. Any information you put on your profile and any content you post on LinkedIn may be seen by others. We don’t provide any of your non-public information (like your email address) to third parties without your consent, unless required by law, or as described in Sections 2.F and 2.N of this Policy. Other people may find your LinkedIn profile information through search engines (you can choose which parts of your public profile are accessible to public search engines in your settings), or use services like Twitter in conjunction with your LinkedIn account. F. Sharing Information with Third Parties LinkedIn offers a “public profile” feature that allows Members to publish portions of their LinkedIn profile to the public Internet. This public profile will be indexed and displayed through public search engines when someone searches for your name. You may choose the parts of your profile that search engines index or completely opt out of this feature in your settings. However, third-party search engines may not automatically update their caches, which may contain old public profile information. Unless you delete it, your profile on LinkedIn is always viewable on the LinkedIn Services. We do not rent or sell personal information that you have not posted on LinkedIn, except as described in this Privacy Policy. We will not disclose personal information that is not published to your profile or generated through engagement with other LinkedIn services, such as Groups and Company Pages, without your consent or to carry out your instructions (for example, to process payment information) unless LinkedIn has a good faith belief that disclosure is permitted by law or is reasonably necessary to: (1) comply with a legal requirement or process, including, but not limited to, civil and criminal subpoenas, court orders or other compulsory disclosures; (2) enforce this Privacy Policy or our User Agreement; (3) respond to claims of a violation of the rights of third parties; (4) respond to Member service inquiries; or (5) protect the rights, property, or safety of LinkedIn, our Members, or the public. See Section 2.N for additional details about LinkedIn’s compliance with legal requests for information. LinkedIn supports middleware providers that offer archiving solutions to firms subject to financial services regulation, which, with your permission, facilitate the archiving of your communications and other LinkedIn activity by a third party for compliance purposes. Content distributed through LinkedIn’s sharing features and third-party integrations may result in displaying some of your personal information outside of LinkedIn. For example, when you post content to a LinkedIn Group that is open for public discussion, your content, including your name as the contributor, may be displayed in search engine results. Also, if you have bound your LinkedIn account to your Twitter account, you can easily share content from LinkedIn to Twitter. We work with developers to build Platform Applications using LinkedIn’s developer tools. Whether you use Platform Applications is up to you. If you have given a Platform Application access to your LinkedIn account, you can revoke that permission anytime. Also, you can opt out of providing information to developers through your connections. G. Developers Using LinkedIn Platform Services We collaborate with and allow third parties to use LinkedIn’s developer platform to offer services and functionality in conjunction with LinkedIn. These third-party developers have either negotiated an agreement to use LinkedIn platform technology or have agreed to our self-service API and Plugin terms in order to build applications (“Platform Applications”). Both the negotiated agreements and our API and Plugin terms contain restrictions on how third parties may access, store, and use the personal information you provide to LinkedIn. If you choose to use a Platform Application, you will be asked to confirm acceptance of the privacy policy and user agreement of the third-party developer. To revoke permission granted to a Platform Application, please visit your settings. Note, however, that even if you revoke the permission granted to a Platform Application, your connections may still be using the Platform Application, so the Platform Application may still have access to certain information about you, just as your connections do. You may opt out of providing information to third-party developers through your connections by accessing the “Turn on/off data sharing with third-party applications” control in the “Groups, Companies, and Applications” tab under settings. We conduct our own surveys and polls and also help third parties do this type of research. Your participation in surveys or polls is up to you. You may also opt out of getting invitations to participate in surveys. H. Polls and Surveys Polls and Surveys may be conducted by LinkedIn, Members, or third parties. Some third parties may target advertisements to you on the results page based on your answers in the poll. LinkedIn or third parties may follow up with you via InMail regarding your participation unless you have opted out of receiving InMail messages. We may use third parties to deliver incentives to you to participate in surveys or polls. If the delivery of incentives requires your contact information, you may be asked to provide personal information to the third party fulfilling the incentive offer, which will be used only for the purpose of delivering incentives and verifying your contact information. It is up to you whether you provide this information, or whether you desire to take advantage of an incentive. Your consent to use any personally identifiable information for the purposes set forth in the poll or survey will be explicitly requested by the party conducting it. LinkedIn is a member of the Council of American Survey Research Organizations (“CASRO”) and abides by CASRO guidelines for market research. You may opt out of participating in surveys by changing your settings to stop receiving these inquiries and requests. LinkedIn helps you search for other professionals, companies, groups, professional content, and jobs. I. Search You can search for Members, employment opportunities, information about companies, and community content from LinkedIn Groups on LinkedIn. For example, you can find Members with particular expertise or experience, or Members that you may know from your industry or profession. You can also find employment opportunities and information about companies. You can also find content from LinkedIn Groups and LinkedIn Today. We use personal information from LinkedIn, including Member profiles, Groups content, and Company Pages, to inform and refine our search service. You are responsible for any information you post on LinkedIn, and this content will be accessible to others. J. Groups If you participate in LinkedIn Groups, share content on your Network Update Stream, or import a blog or other content, you should be aware that any information you choose to disclose using these services can be read, collected, and used by other Members in these forums, developers, and other third parties. LinkedIn is not responsible for the information you choose to submit in these forums. Some content in LinkedIn Groups may be public and searchable on the Internet if the group owner has not closed the group for public discussions. You can identify closed groups by the padlock icon next to the group name. You can remove your LinkedIn Groups posts at any time. However, others may have copied and used the information that you shared. K. Testimonials and Advertisements Placed through LinkedIn Ads If you provide any testimonials about our goods or services or place advertisements through the LinkedIn Ads, we may post those testimonials and examples of advertisements you place in connection with our promotion of these services to third parties. Testimonials and advertisements may include your name and other personal information that you have provided. For more information about LinkedIn Ads, please see the LinkedIn Ads Terms of Use. We offer a premium service to recruiters, which can be used to search for, organize, and communicate with potential candidates. Subscribers to this service may export limited information from members’ public profiles to effectively manage candidate sourcing. You can control how your information is exported by changing which parts of your public profile are accessible to search engines. L. Recruiters We offer customized people-search functionality along with organizational and communications tools as part of our “LinkedIn Recruiter” premium service. LinkedIn Recruiter allows subscribers – generally, enterprises and professional organizations - to export limited information from Members’ public profiles, such as name, headline, current company, current title, and location (for example, San Francisco Bay Area), in order to effectively manage candidate sourcing. You may limit or prevent LinkedIn Recruiter subscribers from exporting your profile information by configuring your public profile visibility settings to restrict access to these fields. We do not provide email or other contact information to Recruiter subscribers. However, if you post that information as part of your profile it will be available to others. A LinkedIn Recruiter subscriber may also manage and store information it has independently obtained about you outside of the Service, such as a resume, in its licensed LinkedIn Recruiter platform. Any personal information obtained independently of LinkedIn services are not under LinkedIn’s control but are subject to the policies of the LinkedIn Recruiter subscriber. We store such information on behalf of the LinkedIn Recruiter subscriber who can remove it at any time. We do not further process such information. Companies and other entities can create pages on LinkedIn. If you follow one of these pages, you’ll be listed as one of the company’s followers, and non-identifiable information about you will be provided to the page’s administrators. M. Pages for Companies, Schools, Influencers, and Other Entities LinkedIn allows companies, schools, charities, and other organizations as well as thought leaders and influencers to create pages dedicated to their brand, business, and mission. These pages are public, and any communications or information shared through them will be accessible by the entity that created them. If you follow a page, you will be listed among the page’s followers, which can be viewed by others. LinkedIn uses aggregate information about followers and viewers to provide data about the page’s performance (for example, visits and updates). We may disclose your personal information if compelled by law, subpoena, or other legal process, or if necessary to enforce our User Agreement. N. Compliance with Legal Process and Other Disclosures It is possible that we may need to disclose personal information, profile information, or information about your activities as a LinkedIn Member when required by law, subpoena, or other legal process, or if LinkedIn has a good faith belief that disclosure is reasonably necessary to (1) investigate, prevent, or take action regarding suspected or actual illegal activities or to assist government enforcement agencies; (2) enforce the User Agreement, investigate and defend ourselves against any third-party claims or allegations, or protect the security or integrity of our Service; or (3) exercise or protect the rights, property, or safety of LinkedIn, our Members, personnel, or others. If there is a change in control or sale of all or part of LinkedIn, we may share your information with a third party, who will have the right to use that information in line with this Privacy Policy. O. Disclosures to Others as the Result of a Change in Control or Sale of LinkedIn Corporation We may also disclose your personal information to a third party as part of a sale of the assets of LinkedIn Corporation, a subsidiary, or division, or as the result of a change in control of the company or one of its affiliates, or in preparation for any of these events. Any third party to which LinkedIn transfers or sells LinkedIn’s assets will have the right to continue to use the personal and other information that you provide to us in the manner set out in this Privacy Policy. Back to Top 3. Your Choices & Obligations You can change your LinkedIn information at any time by editing your profile, deleting content that you have posted, or by closing your account. You can also ask us for additional information we may have about your account. A. Rights to Access, Correct, or Delete Your Information, and Closing Your Account You have a right to (1) access, modify, correct, or delete your personal information controlled by LinkedIn regarding your profile, (2) change or remove your content, and (3) close your account. You can also contact us for any account information which is not on your profile or readily accessible to you. If you close your account, your information will generally be removed from the Service within 24 hours. We generally delete closed account information and will de-identify any logs or other backup information within 30 days of account closure, except as noted below. Please note: Information you have shared with others (for example, through InMail, network updates, content sharing, or LinkedIn Groups) or that others have copied may also remain visible after you have closed your account or deleted the information from your own profile. LinkedIn Groups content associated with closed accounts will show an unknown user as the source. In addition, you may not be able to access, correct, or eliminate any information about you that other Members copied or exported out of LinkedIn, because this information may not be in our control. Your public profile may be displayed in search engine results until the search engine refreshes its cache. We keep your information for as long as your account is active or as needed. For example, we may keep certain information even after you close your account if it is necessary to comply with our legal obligations, meet regulatory requirements, resolve disputes, prevent fraud and abuse, or enforce this agreement. B. Data Retention We retain the personal information you provide while your account is active or as needed to provide you services. LinkedIn may retain your personal information even after you have closed your account if retention is reasonably necessary to comply with our legal obligations, meet regulatory requirements, resolve disputes between Members, prevent fraud and abuse, or enforce this Privacy Policy and our User Agreement. We may retain personal information, for a limited period of time, if requested by law enforcement. LinkedIn Customer Service may retain information for as long as is necessary to provide support-related reporting and trend analysis only, but we generally delete closed account data consistent with Section 3.A., except in the case of our plugin impression data, which we de-personalize after 12 months unless you opt out. Please respect the terms of our User Agreement, our Policies, and your fellow LinkedIn Members. C. Your Obligations As a Member, you have certain obligations to other Members. Some of these obligations are imposed by applicable law and regulations and others have become commonplace in communities of like-minded Members such as LinkedIn: You must, at all times, abide by the terms and conditions of the current Privacy Policy, User Agreement, and other policies of LinkedIn. This includes respecting all intellectual property rights that may belong to third parties, such as trademarks or copyrights. You must not upload or otherwise disseminate any information that may infringe on the rights of others or which may be deemed to be injurious, violent, offensive, racist, or xenophobic, or which may otherwise violate the purpose and spirit of LinkedIn and its community of Members. You must keep your username and password confidential and not share it with others. Any violation of these guidelines or those detailed in our User Agreement or elsewhere may lead to the restriction, suspension, or termination of your account at the sole discretion of LinkedIn. Back to Top 4. Important Information You have to meet LinkedIn’s minimum age requirements to create an account. A.

California's Shine the Light Law California Civil Code Section 1798.83, known as the “Shine The Light” law, permits our customers who are California residents to request and obtain from us a list of what personal information (if any) we disclosed to third parties for direct marketing purposes in the preceding calendar year and the names and addresses of those third parties. Requests may be made only once a year and are free of charge. Under Section 1798.83, LinkedIn currently does not share any personal information with third parties for their direct marketing purposes.

Third-party websites There are a number of places on our website where you may click on a link to access other websites that do not operate under this Privacy Policy. For example, if you click on an advertisement on our website, you may be taken to a website that we do not control. These third-party websites may independently solicit and collect information, including personal information, from you and, in some instances, provide us with information about your activities on those websites. We recommend that you consult the privacy statements of all third-party websites you visit by clicking on the privacy link typically located at the bottom of the webpage you are visiting. How you can access your information If you have an online account with us, you have the ability to review and update your personal information online by logging into your account and clicking on your account settings. More information about how to contact us is provided below. If you have an online account with us, you also may close your account at any time by visiting the Account Settings page for your account. After you close your account, you will not be able to sign in to our website or access any of your personal information. However, you can open a new, separate account at any time or re-activate your previous account by following instructions we will give you at the time you close your account. If you close your account, we may still retain certain information associated with your account for analytical purposes and recordkeeping integrity, as well as to prevent fraud, collect any fees owed, enforce our terms and conditions, take actions we deem necessary to protect the integrity of our website or our users, or take other actions otherwise permitted by law. In addition, if certain information has already been provided to third parties as described in this Privacy Policy, retention of that information will be subject to those third parties' policies. Your choices about collection and use of your information You can choose not to provide us with certain information, but that may result in you being unable to use certain features of our website because such information may be required in order for you to register as a member; purchase products or services; participate in a contest, promotion, survey, or sweepstakes; ask a question; or initiate other transactions on our website. At any time you can choose to no longer receive commercial or promotional emails from us by visiting the Account Settings page associated with your account.

It may take up to 10 days for us to process an opt-out request. We may send you other types of transactional and relationship email communications, such as service announcements, administrative notices, and surveys, without offering you the opportunity to opt out of receiving them. Please note that changing information in your account, or otherwise opting out of receipt of promotional email communications will only affect future activities or communications from us. If we have already provided your information to a third party (such as a service provider) before you have changed your preferences or updated your information, you may have to change you preferences directly with that third party. You may tell us not to share your personal information with third parties or the IAC family of companies for direct marketing purposes by visiting the Account Settings page associated with your account after you have registered.

How we protect your personal information We take appropriate security measures (including physical, electronic and procedural measures) to help safeguard your personal information from unauthorized access and disclosure. We want you to feel confident using our website to transact business. However, no system can be completely secure. Therefore, although we take steps to secure your information, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your personal information, searches, or other communications will always remain secure. Users should also take care with how they handle and disclose their personal information and should avoid sending personal information through insecure email. Please refer to the Federal Trade Commission's website at http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/menus/consumer/data.shtm for information about how to protect yourself against identity theft. Information you provide about yourself while using our service We provide areas on our websites where you can post information about yourself and others and communicate with others or upload content such as photographs. Such postings are governed by our Terms of Use. In addition, such postings may appear on other websites or when searches are executed on the subject of your posting. Also, whenever you voluntarily disclose personal information on publicly-viewable web pages, that information will be publicly available and can be collected and used by others. For example, if you post your email address, you may receive unsolicited messages. We cannot control who reads your posting or what other users may do with the information you voluntarily post, so we encourage you to exercise discretion and caution with respect to your personal information. Children's privacy Although our website is a general audience site, we restrict the use of our service to individuals age 18 and above. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13.

Cookies can be either session cookies or persistent cookies. A session cookie expires when you close your browser and is used to make it easier for you to navigate our website. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time. Cookies on our website do not link to or store your personal information. For example, when you sign in to our website, we will record your user or member ID and the name associated with your user or member ID in the cookie file on your computer. We also may record your password in this cookie file, if you indicated that you would like your password saved for automatic sign-in. For security purposes, we will encrypt any usernames, passwords, and other user or member account-related data that we store in such cookies. In the case of sites and services that do not use a user or member ID, the cookie will contain a unique identifier. We may allow our authorized service providers to serve cookies from our website to allow them to assist us in various activities, such as doing analysis and research on the effectiveness of our site, content and advertising. You may delete or decline cookies by changing your browser settings. (Click Help in the toolbar of most browsers for instructions.) If you do so, some of the features and services of our website may not function properly. We may allow third-parties, including IAC companies, advertising companies, and ad networks, to display advertisements on our site. These companies may use tracking technologies, such as cookies, to collect information about users who view or interact with their advertisements. Our website does not provide any personal information to these third parties, but they may collect information about where you, or others who are using your computer, saw and/or clicked on the advertisements they deliver (such as click stream information, browser type, time and date, subject of advertisements clicked or scrolled over, etc.), and possibly associate this information with your subsequent visits to the advertised websites. They also may combine this information with personal information they collect from you to provide advertisements about goods and services likely to be of greater interest to you. The collection and use of that information is subject to the third-party's privacy policy. This information allows them to deliver targeted advertisements and gauge their effectiveness. Some of these third-party advertising companies may be advertising networks that are members of the Network Advertising Initiative, which offers a single location to opt out of ad targeting from member companies and provides information about this behavioral advertising practice (www.networkadvertising.org). This policy covers the use of cookies by Match.com only and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers. Opting-Out of Advertising Cookies. You may opt out of our data collection for use by third party ad companies to provide targeted Match.com advertising to you when you visit other sites. Cookies are unique to each computer. Therefore, you must opt out separately on all computers you use. If you delete all of your cookies (specifically, the Opt-Out cookie), you will have to go through the opt-out process again to reactivate your opted-out status. You can opt out of receiving such advertising-related cookies by clicking below: Opt Out Now. Web Beacons: Web beacons (also known as clear gifs, pixel tags or web bugs) are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of web users or to access cookies. Unlike cookies which are stored on the user's computer hard drive, web beacons are embedded invisibly on the web pages (or in email) and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. Web beacons may be used to deliver or communicate with cookies, to count users who have visited certain pages and to understand usage patterns. We also may receive an anonymous identification number if you come to our site from an online advertisement displayed on a third-party website. Third parties may use anonymous information about your visits to our site and other websites in order to improve its products and services and provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you.");

 	// Merriam-Webster Privacy Policy, http://www.merriam-webster.com/info/privacy.htm, retrieved 07/13/2013
	sessionStorage.setItem("TRAIND", "Privacy Policy Updated June 13, 2011 Merriam-Webster is committed to respecting the privacy of visitors to its Web sites. The guidelines below explain how we protect the privacy of visitors to Merriam-Webster.com and its features. Personally Identifiable Information Merriam-Webster protects the identity of visitors to Merriam-Webster.com by limiting the collection of personally identifiable information. For certain promotions and to access certain features, such as to receive a Word of the Day subscription, we may request a voluntary submission of information such as name, e-mail address, city, state, and age. Merriam-Webster does not knowingly collect or solicit personally identifiable information from or about children under 13, except as permitted by law. If we discover we have received any information from a child under 13 in violation of this policy, we will delete that information immediately. If you believe Merriam-Webster has any information from or about anyone under 13, please e-mail us at privacy@m-w.com. All personally identifiable information you provide to us for subscriptions through Merriam-Webster.com is used by Merriam-Webster and its staff to process and manage subscriptions, analyze the demographic of our subscribers, or to deliver services through the site; such information may also be used by the company for prize or information-request fulfillment unless otherwise indicated. Such information will not be posted or published by us, and will be shared with third parties only for the purpose of payment processing. If you choose to provide personally identifiable information to us, you may receive the following types of e-mails from us: E-mails related to subscription-maintenance activities. Periodic e-mail newsletters highlighting new features, content, and usage tips for Merriam-Webster.com. Periodic special offers for additional Merriam-Webster and Encyclopædia Britannica (Merriam-Webster's parent company) products and services. Periodic special offers from Merriam-Webster approved partners if you opt-in or give us your permission to send them. When you provide personally identifiable information to us, you can let us know that you do not wish to receive special Merriam-Webster or partner offers. Each offer will also have information available to allow you to opt out if you wish to receive no further offers. Merriam-Webster.com may also use other third-party providers to facilitate the delivery of the services described above, and these third-party providers may be supplied with or have access to personally identifiable information for the sole purpose of providing these services, such as Word of the Day,to you on behalf of Merriam-Webster.com. Merriam-Webster may also disclose personally identifiable information in special legal circumstances. For instance, such information may be used where it is necessary to protect our copyright or intellectual property rights, or if the law requires us to do so. Anonymous Information Anonymous aggregated data may be provided to other companies we do business with for statistical purposes. For example, we may report to advertisers that a certain percentage of our site's visitors are adults between the ages of 25 and 35. Cookies and Beacons—Use by Merriam-Webster; Opting Out We use cookies and software logs to monitor the use of Merriam-Webster.com and to gather non-personal information about visitors to the site. Cookies are small files that Merriam-Webster transfers to the hard drives of visitors for record-keeping purposes. These monitoring systems allow us to track general information about our visitors, such as the type of browsers (for example, Firefox or Internet Explorer), the operating systems (for instance, Windows or Macintosh), or the Internet providers (for instance, Comcast) they use. This information is used for statistical and market research purposes to tailor content to usage patterns and to provide services requested by our customers. To delete these cookies, please see your browser's privacy settings. A beacon is an electronic file object (typically a transparent image) placed in the code of a Web page. We use third party beacons to monitor the traffic patterns of visitors from one Merriam-Webster.com page to another and to improve site performance. None of the information we gather in this way can be used to identify any individual who visits our site. Cookies and Beacons—Use by Third-Parties; Opting Out Advertisers and advertising networks use cookies and beacons to target ads served to Merriam-Webster.com. What does it mean to serve ads? When you visit a Web site, your Internet browser transmits a request to the computer that hosts the Web site (the host server) requesting that server to send you (or serve) the Web page that you are seeking. Most Web pages contain components that are pulled from different sources, for example, a Web page at a news site may get its weather section from one provider, its sports results from a different source, and advertisements from other servers. Our Web pages contain coding that directs your browser to fill the ad spaces on the Web pages with content served by advertisers and networks of advertisers to whom we have sold the ad spaces. The advertisers and networks use cookies and beacons to help manage ad delivery and frequency, and to identify audience segment(s) for customized advertising (targeting). These cookies are used to identify your IP address, so that when you visit another Web site using the same advertising network, the network will recognize the cookie as one of its own, read the information on the cookie (the record of which sites in the network you have visited) and serve you an ad that you might be interested in, based on your past visits to other sites in the network. Advertising targeted based on past Web surfing is known as behavioral advertising. Merriam-Webster does not permit any advertisers or networks to collect personally identifiable information about visitors to Merriam-Webster.com using cookies or beacons. Our Privacy Policy does not cover the use of information that they may have collected from you on other sites. If you would like to learn more about behavioral advertising or to opt out of having this information used by companies that are part of the Network Advertising Initiative to deliver targeted ads, please visit http://www.networkadvertising.org. Many of the same companies are members of the Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavioral Advertising. You can learn more and opt out of receiving targeted ads from them at http://www.aboutads.info/choices. Some advertising networks require that we specifically list their opt-out links below. When you opt-out of a network, you may receive an opt-out cookie so that the network will know not to assign you new cookies in the future. You will continue to receive ads from that network, but not behaviorally targeted ads. If you erase your browser's cookies, you may need to perform this process again. 24/7 Real Media http://www.247realmedia.com/privacy.html Adconion http://www.adconion.com/us/privacy-policy/the-adconion-cookie.html Collective Media http://www.networkadvertising.org DoubleClick http://www.doubleclick.com/privacy/faq.aspx Google http://www.google.com/privacy_ads.html SpotXChange click here. When you select this option, SpotXchange sets a persistent opt-out cookie to prevent information from being uniquely associated with your browser. ValueClick http://www.valueclickmedia.com/member_privacy.shtml. We have contracted with ValueClick to monitor certain pages of our site for the purpose of reporting traffic, statistics, advertisement 'click-throughs', and/or other activities on our site. Where authorized by us, ValueClick and its business partners may use cookies, web beacons, and/or other monitoring technologies to compile anonymous statistics about our visitors. No personally identifiable information is collected by or transferred to any party other than the advertiser. For more information about how the information is collected and used by ValueClick, please see ValueClick's privacy policy at http://www.valueclickmedia.com/member_privacy.shtml.

In such transactions, customer information generally is one of the transferred business assets but remains subject to the promises made in any pre-existing Privacy Policy (unless, of course, the customer consents otherwise). Also, in the unlikely event that Merriam-Webster, or substantially all of its assets are acquired, customer information will be one of the transferred assets, and will remain subject to our Privacy Policy. Your California Privacy Rights If you are a California resident, you are entitled to prevent sharing of your personal information with third parties for their own marketing purposes through a cost-free means. If you send a request to the address above, Merriam-Webster will provide you with a California Customer Choice Notice that you may use to opt-out of such information sharing.

 	// Microsoft Privacy Statement, http://privacy.microsoft.com/en-us/fullnotice.mspx, retrieved 07/11/2013
	sessionStorage.setItem("TRAIND", "This privacy statement applies to websites and services of Microsoft that collect data and display these terms, as well as its offline product support services. It does not apply to those Microsoft sites, services and products that do not display or link to this statement or that have their own privacy statements. Please read the Microsoft Online Privacy Statement below and also any supplemental information listed to the right for further details about particular Microsoft sites and services you use. Some products, services or features mentioned in this statement may not be available in all markets at this time. Additional information on Microsoft’s commitment to protecting your privacy can be found at http://www.microsoft.com/privacy. Collection of Your Personal Information We collect information as part of operating our Websites and services.	 At some Microsoft sites, we ask you to provide personal information, such as your e-mail address, name, home or work address, or telephone number. We may also collect demographic information, such as your ZIP code, age, gender, preferences, interests and favorites. If you choose to make a purchase or sign up for a paid subscription service, we will ask for additional information, such as your credit card number and billing address.  In order to access some Microsoft services, you will be asked to sign in with an e-mail address and password, which we refer to as your Microsoft account. By signing in on one Microsoft site or service, you may be automatically signed into other Microsoft sites and services that use Microsoft account. For more information, see the Windows Live ID privacy supplement. We collect additional information about your interaction with Microsoft sites and services without identifying you as an individual. For example, we receive certain standard information that your browser sends to every website you visit, such as your IP address, browser type and language, access times and referring Web site addresses. We also use Web site analytics tools on our sites to retrieve information from your browser, including the site you came from, the search engine(s) and the keywords you used to find our site, the pages you view within our site, your browser add-ons, and your browser's width and height. We use technologies, such as cookies and web beacons (described below), to collect information about the pages you view, the links you click and other actions you take on our sites and services. We also deliver advertisements (see the Display of Advertising section below) and provide Web site analytics tools on non-Microsoft sites and services, and we collect information about page views on these third party sites as well. When you receive newsletters or promotional e-mail from Microsoft, we may use web beacons (described below), customized links or similar technologies to determine whether the e-mail has been opened and which links you click in order to provide you more focused e-mail communications or other information. In order to offer you a more consistent and personalized experience in your interactions with Microsoft, information collected through one Microsoft service may be combined with information obtained through other Microsoft services. We may also supplement the information we collect with information obtained from other companies. For example, we may use services from other companies that enable us to derive a general geographic area based on your IP address in order to customize certain services to your geographic area. Top of page Use of Your Personal Information Microsoft collects and uses your personal information to operate and improve its sites and services. These uses include providing you with more effective customer service; making the sites or services easier to use by eliminating the need for you to repeatedly enter the same information; performing research and analysis aimed at improving our products, services and technologies; and displaying content and advertising that are customized to your interests and preferences. For more information about the use of information for advertising, see the Display of Advertising section below. We also use your personal information to communicate with you. We may send certain mandatory service communications such as welcome letters, billing reminders, information on technical service issues, and security announcements. Some Microsoft services, such as Windows Live Hotmail, may send periodic member letters that are considered part of the service. Additionally, with your permission, we may also occasionally send you product surveys or promotional mailings to inform you of other products or services available from Microsoft and its affiliates, and/or share your personal information with Microsoft partners so they may send you information about their products and services. You can opt-out from receiving newsletters or promotional e-mail anytime by using this web form or by following the steps as described in the respective newsletter or promotional e-mail. Personal information collected on Microsoft sites and services may be stored and processed in the United States or any other country in which Microsoft or its affiliates, subsidiaries or service providers maintain facilities. Microsoft abides by the U.S.-EU Safe Harbor Framework and the U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of data from the European Economic Area, and Switzerland.

Top of page Sharing of Your Personal Information Except as described in this statement, we will not disclose your personal information outside of Microsoft and its controlled subsidiaries and affiliates without your consent. Some Microsoft sites allow you to choose to share your personal information with select Microsoft partners so that they can contact you about their products, services or offers. Other sites, such as MSN instead may give you a separate choice as to whether you wish to receive communications from Microsoft about a partner's particular offering (without transferring your personal information to the third party). See the Communication Preferences section below for more information. Some Microsoft services are co-branded by Microsoft and another company (partner). If you register to or use such a service, both a Microsoft privacy statement and the partner’s privacy statement may be displayed. If so, both Microsoft and the partner will receive information you provide such as on registration forms. Microsoft occasionally hires other companies (vendor) to provide limited services on our behalf, such as handling the processing and delivery of mailings, providing customer support, hosting websites, processing transactions, or performing statistical analysis of our services. Those service providers will be permitted to obtain only the personal information they need to deliver the service. They are required to maintain the confidentiality of the information and are prohibited from using it for any other purpose than for delivering the service to Microsoft in accordance with Microsoft’s instructions and policies. However, our vendors may use aggregate data for fraud detection to help improve their services. This helps them to more accurately detect fraudulent transactions. We may access or disclose information about you, including the content of your communications, in order to: (a) comply with the law or respond to lawful requests or legal process; (b) protect the rights or property of Microsoft or our customers, including the enforcement of our agreements or policies governing your use of the services; or (c) act on a good faith belief that such access or disclosure is necessary to protect the personal safety of Microsoft employees, customers or the public. We may also disclose personal information as part of a corporate transaction such as a merger or sale of assets.

Top of page Display of Advertising (Opt-Out) Many of our Web sites and online services are supported by advertising. Most of the online advertisements on Microsoft sites are displayed by Microsoft Advertising. When we display online advertisements to you, we will place one or more persistent cookies on your computer in order to recognize your computer each time we display an ad to you. Because we serve advertisements on our own websites as well as those of our advertising and publisher partners, we are able to compile information over time about the types of pages, content and ads you, or others who are using your computer, visited or viewed. This information is used for many purposes, for example, it helps us try to ensure that you do not see the same advertisements over and over again. We also use this information to help select and display targeted advertisements that we believe may be of interest to you. You may opt-out of receiving targeted ads from Microsoft Advertising by visiting our opt-out page. For more information about how Microsoft Advertising collects and uses information, please see the Microsoft Advertising Privacy Supplement. We also allow third-party ad companies, including other ad networks, to display advertisements on our sites. In some cases, these third parties may also place cookies on your computer. These companies currently include, but are not limited to: 24/7 Real Media, aCerno,Inc, AdBlade, AdConion, AdFusion, Advertising.com, AppNexus, Bane Media, Brand.net, CasaleMedia, Collective Media, Fox Interactive, Interclick, Millennial, PrecisionClick, ROI Media, Social Media, SpecificMedia, TrafficMarketplace, Tribal Fusion, ValueClick, Yahoo!, YuMe, and Zumobi. These companies may offer you a way to opt-out of ad targeting based on their cookies. You may find more information by clicking on the company names above and following the links to the Web sites of each company. Many of them are also members of the Network Advertising Initiative or the Digital Advertising Alliance, which each provide a simple way to opt-out of ad targeting from participating companies. Top of page Security of Your Personal Information Microsoft is committed to protecting the security of your personal information. We use a variety of security technologies and procedures to help protect your personal information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. For example, we store the personal information we collect on computer systems with limited access, which are located in controlled facilities. When we transmit highly confidential information (such as a credit card number or password) over the Internet, we protect it through the use of encryption, such as the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol. If a password is used to help protect your accounts and personal information, it is your responsibility to keep your password confidential. Do not share this information with anyone. If you are sharing a computer with anyone you should always log out before leaving a site or service to protect access to your information from subsequent users. Top of page Collection and Use of Children's Personal Information Many Microsoft sites and services are intended for general audiences and do not knowingly collect any personal information from children. When a Microsoft site does collect age information, and users identify themselves as under 13, the site will either block such users from providing personal information, or will seek to obtain consent from parents for the collection, use and sharing of their children's personal information. We will not knowingly ask children under the age of 13 to provide more information than is reasonably necessary to provide our services. Please note that if you grant consent for your child to use Microsoft services, this will include such general audience communication services as e-mail, instant messaging, and online groups, and your child will be able to communicate with, and disclose personal information to, other users of all ages. Parents can change or revoke the consent choices previously made, and review, edit or request the deletion of their children's personal information. For example, on MSN and Windows Live, parents can visit Account Services, and click on “Permission for kids.” If we change this privacy statement in a way that expands the collection, use or disclosure of children's personal information to which a parent has previously consented, the parent will be notified and we will be required to obtain the parent's additional consent. If you have an MSN Premium, MSN Plus, or MSN 9 Dial-Up account, and use MSN Client software version 9.5 or below, you can choose to set up MSN Parental Controls for the other users of that account. Please read the supplemental privacy information for MSN for further information. We encourage you to talk with your children about communicating with strangers and disclosing personal information online. You and your child can visit our online safety resources for additional information about using the Internet safely. Top of page Use of Cookies Most Microsoft Web sites use cookies, which are small text files placed on your hard disk by a Web server. Cookies contain information that can later be read by a Web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you. One of the primary purposes of cookies is to store your preferences and other information on your computer in order to save you time by eliminating the need to repeatedly enter the same information and to display your personalized content and targeted advertising on your later visits to these sites. Microsoft Web sites also use cookies as described in the Display of Advertising sections of this privacy statement. When you sign in to a site using your Microsoft account, we store your unique ID number, and the time you signed in, in an encrypted cookie on your hard disk. This cookie allows you to move from page to page at the site without having to sign in again on each page. When you sign out, these cookies are deleted from your computer. We also use cookies to improve the sign in experience. For example, your e-mail address may be stored in a cookie that will remain on your computer after you sign out. This cookie allows your e-mail address to be pre-populated, so that you will only need to type your password the next time you sign in. If you are using a public computer or do not otherwise want this information to be stored, you can select the appropriate radio button on the sign-in page, and this cookie will not be used. You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to sign in or use other interactive features of Microsoft sites and services that depend on cookies, and some advertising preferences that are dependent on cookies may not be able to be respected. If you choose to accept cookies, you also have the ability to later delete cookies that you have accepted. For example, in Internet Explorer 8, you can delete cookies by selecting “Tools”, “Delete browsing history”. Then select the control box “Cookies and click the “Delete” button. If you choose to delete cookies, any settings and preferences controlled by those cookies, including advertising preferences, will be deleted and may need to be recreated. Top of page Use of Web Beacons Microsoft Web pages may contain electronic images known as Web beacons - sometimes called single-pixel gifs - that may be used to assist in delivering cookies on our sites and allow us to count users who have visited those pages and to deliver co-branded services. We may include Web beacons in promotional e-mail messages or our newsletters in order to determine whether messages have been opened and acted upon. Microsoft may also employ Web beacons from third parties in order to help us compile aggregated statistics regarding the effectiveness of our promotional campaigns or other operations of our sites. We prohibit Web beacons on our sites from being used by third parties to collect or access your personal information. Finally, we may work with other companies that advertise on Microsoft sites to place Web beacons on their sites in order to allow us to develop statistics on how often clicking on an advertisement on a Microsoft site results in a purchase or other action on the advertiser's site. Top of page Controlling Unsolicited E-mail (Spam) Microsoft is concerned about controlling unsolicited commercial e-mail, or spam. Microsoft has a strict Anti-Spam Policy prohibiting the use of a Windows Live Hotmail or other Microsoft-provided e-mail account to send spam. Microsoft will not sell, lease or rent its e-mail subscriber lists to third parties. . While Microsoft continues to actively review and implement new technology, such as expanded filtering features, there is no technology that will totally prevent the sending and receiving of unsolicited e-mail. Using junk e-mail tools and being cautious about the sharing of your e-mail address while online will help reduce the amount of unsolicited e-mail you receive. Top of page TRUSTe Certification Microsoft has been awarded TRUSTe's Privacy Seal signifying that this privacy statement and our practices have been reviewed by TRUSTe for compliance with TRUSTe's program requirements including transparency, accountability and choice regarding the collection and use of your personal information.

This information is necessary for providing personalized and location-based content as well as for analyzing the use of resources, troubleshooting problems, preventing fraud, and improving our services. We may combine this information with information in your account to help prevent fraud. If you choose to login with Facebook or similar sites, we import the information that you choose to share with us by installing the application or logging into that platform or site, and we make it part of your profile. Because Monster sites and applications are intended to allow you to share your information and to allow others to find you, we make certain information about you publicly available by default. Such information may, for example, be accessed by everyone on the Internet, including users without accounts, and may appear in public search engine search results. However, you can control the visibility of your information by managing your privacy settings. You can also restrict the information available to others by deleting information you do not want visible or by not providing it at all. When you post information on another user’s profile or comment on another user’s post, the public availability of that information will be subject to the other user’s privacy settings. How We Use Information We use the information we collect to provide our services, respond to you, operate and improve our sites and applications, and foster a positive user experience. Our services include the display of personalized products, content, and advertising relating to your career experience and interests, either on our site or other sites with which we have a business relationship. By registering with Monster, by managing your profile, or by opting in when presented with choices, you have consented for us to use your information in the following ways: to create a profile for you based on information that you have provided to us, information imported from other sites or applications, or information provided to us by third parties such as your contacts or advertisers; to provide personalized, targeted, or location-based content, services, and advertising from us and third parties; to allow you to contact other users or to invite others to join or create and account; to allow you to import information about yourself or your contacts from other sites or applications or to export your information to other sites or applications; to make purchases; to contact you about feature updates, informational and service-related communications, including important security updates; to provide you with additional communications, information, and promotions such as newsletters and career advice; to inform you of other products or services available from Monster or its affiliates; to enable you to contact us and for us to respond to you to conduct surveys, promotions and contests, and to publish the results thereof; to help your friends, contacts, and potential employers find your profile and connect with you; to provide information about you and your potential interest in job postings to employer customers; to provide products and services to employer customers to complete the recruitment and hiring process; to provide products and services that enable users to network, post information on bulletin boards, view and compare profiles; to generate internal reports about the use of our sites and applications; to allow you to share jobs and profile information with your connections; to give search engines access to public information; to detect, investigate and prevent activities that may violate our policies or be illegal; and to make suggestions and draw inferences about you. For example, we may make suggestions about people you may know or additional jobs, products or services that might be of interest to you. Or, if you identify yourself as Mrs. we will assume you are female. Some of our products and services, such as our searchable resume database and networking, enable third parties to see your personal information and to contact you. Profile information may be used for networking with other community members or may be visible to employers who are using Monster sites and applications. Information you post in public areas of Monster sites or applications or place in the searchable resume database may be accessed, used, and stored by others around the world, including those in countries that might not have legislation that guarantees adequate protection of personal information as defined by your country of residence. While Monster takes measures to safeguard your information from unauthorized access or inappropriate use, Monster does not control these third parties and we are not responsible for their use of information you give to us. Accordingly, you should not post sensitive information, personality profiles, or any other information you would not want made public, to any Monster site or application. We use data we have about you to determine whether you might be interested in the opportunities, products or services of a particular third party. We show you targeted ads on our sites or other sites with which we have a business relationship. These ads are targeted based on information we collect about you and information about you we acquire from third parties. How We Share Information One of our primary purposes is to provide you with a platform to broadcast the information in your resume and profile widely in order to maximize your career opportunities. The information we gather may be shared within the Monster group of companies on a worldwide basis. We do not share information with third parties for their direct marketing purposes unless you affirmatively agree to such disclosure. We disclose your information as set forth below: 1. We share your information with third parties who help deliver our products and services to you. Examples include hosting our web servers, including resume database storage, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance, processing credit card payments, and providing customer service. These companies will have access to your personal information as necessary to perform their functions, but they may not use that data for any other purpose. We will remain responsible for any information shared in this way. 2. We may disclose information to third parties if you consent. For example: (a) if you make your resume searchable, then all parties with access to our searchable resume database will have access to your resume; (b) if you opt in to receive information about the opportunities, products, or services of third parties, we supply your contact information to those third parties so they may contact you; (c) if you previously chose to receive newsletters, commercial e-mails or other communications from Monster or third parties, but subsequently change your mind, you may opt out in those emails or by editing your account profile as described above. By applying to a job or providing your contact information to show interest in a job, you consent to the disclosure of your information to that employer. We also share aggregated information (including location data) about Monster site visitors and application users with third parties to serve advertisements to you on our sites or other sites with which we have a business relationship. We may also aggregate data regarding job qualifications, schooling, age, experience level or other information relevant to the job search. This aggregated data does not identify users individually, and may be made available to employers or fellow job seekers or community members. If we create a co-branded site with another company, information will be retained by both companies and subject to the privacy policies of both companies which will be published on the co-branded sites. 3. We disclose information if legally required to do so, or at our discretion pursuant to a request from a governmental entity or if we believe in good faith – after considering your privacy interests and other factors – that such action is necessary to: (a) meet legal requirements or comply with legal process; (b) protect our rights or property or our affiliated companies; (c) prevent a crime or protect national security; or (d) protect the personal safety of users or the public. 4. We may disclose and transfer information to a third party who acquires any or all of Monster’s business units, whether such acquisition is by way of merger, consolidation or purchase of all or a substantial portion of our assets. In addition, in the event Monster becomes the subject of an insolvency proceeding, such information will be disposed of in a transaction approved by the court. You will be notified of the sale of all or a substantial portion of our business to a third party by email or through a prominent notice posted on the site. An Important Note About Your Resume When you create or post a resume, we store it in our searchable resume database in the United States. You may control the status of your resume by setting it to visible, limited, or private. Visible and limited resumes can be found by anyone with access to our resume database. We cannot control the retention, use or privacy of resumes that have been viewed or downloaded by others. Private resumes will not be searchable in our resume database. You may still use your private resume to apply online to a job. If you do, your resume will be transferred to the relevant employer, who may retain a copy of your resume or distribute it to third parties. We attempt to limit access to our searchable resume database to legitimate users such as paying employers, recruiters, hiring managers, headhunters and human resource professionals, but cannot guarantee that other parties will not gain access to this database. We cannot control the use made of resumes by third parties who access the resume database. Once your resume has been disclosed, Monster is not able to retrieve it from the third parties who accessed it. You may remove your resume from our searchable database at any time. However anyone who viewed your resume may have kept a copy of it in their own files or databases. Accordingly, you should not put sensitive information, personality profiles, or other information you would not want made public, in your resume. If you provide us with details of a reference, it is your responsibility to ensure that the person is aware that you have forwarded his/her details and has consented in writing for you to do so. Resumes you give to us must not contain sensitive data relating to your (i) racial or ethnic origin (ii) political beliefs (iii) philosophical or religious beliefs (iv) membership of a trade union or political party (v) physical or mental health or biometric details or genetic makeup (vi) addictions, sexual life (vii) the commission of criminal offences or proceedings and associated penalties or fines, (viii) the commission of any unlawful or objectionable conduct and associated penalties, or (ix) any Social Security Number or national identification number. If your resume does contain this information, then you agree that it is at your own risk. We cannot control third parties’ access to such information from our searchable database. How We Store Information Because managing your career is a life-long process, we retain all the information we gather about you in an effort to make repeat use of our sites more efficient, practical and relevant until you change or remove your personal data as described below. You may access, review, correct, update, change or delete your profile or resume at any time. Log into your account, go to your profile or resume, and make the desired changes. Access to or correction, update, or deletion of your personal information may be denied or limited by Monster if it would violate another person’s rights and/or as otherwise permitted by applicable law. If you wish to delete or close your account or account profile information altogether, please click here to contact us. We will send you an email to confirm that your personal information has been deleted (save for an archival copy which is not accessible by you or third parties on the Internet). The archival copy is retained only for as long as needed for audit and record purposes. We will also keep logs and information that may relate to your activity on the site. We will respond to information access requests without undue delay of receipt and in any event within 30 days. If we require additional time to provide access to your information, we will acknowledge receipt of your request within 30 days and promptly supplement our response within the time period required by applicable law. If you are a job seeker with a public resume and have not logged onto Monster for an extended period, we may make your resume unsearchable. Separately, and regardless of your resume privacy setting, if you do not log into your account for a significant period of time, it will expire and be scheduled for deletion. Expired accounts are deleted on a periodic basis. Our current expiration period is approximately 36 months; we may extend or reduce this period in order to adjust to changing hiring patterns. If we change the period, we will update this notice. You will always receive an email from us before we delete your resume in this manner. Security You are responsible for keeping your username and password secret. Monster takes appropriate measures to secure your personal information from accidental loss and from unauthorized access, use, alteration or disclosure. However, the Internet is an open system and we cannot guarantee that unauthorized third parties will not be able to defeat those measures or use your personal information for improper purposes. You can find additional information on conducting a safe job search in our Security Center. You should be aware that resumes may be monitored by your current employer. When you place an order online at Monster, your credit card information is encrypted with industry standard encryption. This makes it difficult for your credit card information to be intercepted or stolen while being transmitted. Monster uses a service company to process its credit card transactions.

Please scroll down to see the full Privacy Policy. Location-Based Services NPR collects geolocation data through the NPR Services for purposes of offering visitors relevant content, including content from nearby Member stations. Geolocation data consists of general location information based on latitude and longitude, rounded to a few miles radius, or based on IP addresses. Gathering of Information NPR collects contact information, such as name, address, email address, and phone number, that users voluntarily submit by, for example, registering for newsletters or an NPR account, creating a public profile for your account, making a purchase in the NPR Shop, sharing a story, or submitting comments or materials to NPR. NPR collects credit card numbers provided by NPR Shop customers. NPR's web server creates access logs for visitors to the NPR Services, recording such information as IP address, date and time of visit, path taken, browser, list of files downloaded or viewed, and time spent listening to audio. NPR collects information from a visitor's mobile device or app, including device identifier, operating system, phone model, app version and automobile make. NPR may collect information related to content preferences and, only with the visitor's specific additional consent, other personal information (such as age or gender) that the visitor has chosen to associate with the visitor's social media account(s). NPR uses cookies and web beacons to track certain user activity. NPR's third party vendors that provide analytics services, provide NPR's discussion platform, and serve sponsorship messages also may use their own cookies and web beacons. Use of Information NPR uses the personal information it gathers (a) to provide requested products and services, (b) to identify users when NPR publishes material they submitted, and (c) for internal NPR and NPR Member station purposes. NPR uses access logs, content preferences, cookies and web beacons to analyze use of the NPR Services, offer interactive features, and personalize the NPR Services, such as by recalling user information so that the user does not have to re-enter it, offering local station content or other content that may be of interest to the visitor, and displaying more relevant sponsorship messages, Sharing Information with Third Parties NPR generally does not share personal information it gathers with third parties, except with NPR member stations, NPR service vendors (to the extent necessary for the vendor to provide the services), and other third parties when the user consents. Any information a user posts or shares through the NPR Services will become available to the public. NPR will release user information when required to do so by law or when it believes it is necessary to protect NPR, NPR employees, users of the NPR Services, or the public. Contact If you have questions, wish to correct, update or remove any of your personal information, or wish to opt out of future communications from NPR, please Contact Us. Full Version of Privacy Policy At NPR (which refers to NPR and its subsidiary organizations), we recognize the importance of privacy to visitors of NPR.org, NPR's mobile sites and applications, any other NPR sites, applications and services, and any features of these sites, applications and services (the NPR Services). This Privacy Policy explains what type of information is collected from you when you visit the NPR Services and how that information may be used. Please note that this Privacy Policy is separate and distinct from the privacy policies governing the web sites, applications and services of NPR's member stations, and the web sites, applications and services that may link to or from the NPR Services. Gathering of Information NPR collects personally-identifying information (such as your name, e-mail address, address, telephone number, and credit card information) from the NPR Services for a variety of purposes. NPR asks visitors to provide certain personal information when they register for certain features or services of the NPR Services (for example, an NPR account, Application Programming Interface (API) Content access, and NPR e-mail newsletters), when they create a public profile for their NPR account, when they e-mail, send via SMS (Short Message Service) or text message, or otherwise share a story from the NPR Services, when they make a purchase from the NPR Shop, when they post, upload, transmit and/or otherwise submit (Submit) a comment, message, story idea, essay, photo, image, or other text, content or material (User Materials), and when they register for an NPR tour or event or any online contests. NPR also may ask visitors to provide personal information in other limited circumstances specified at the time the information is gathered. Any information that you Submit on or through NPR's social networking features, forums and discussions, as part of story or blog comments, or otherwise Submit to the NPR Services, may become public, including the full name and nickname that you provide when registering an NPR account or creating a public profile. Within NPR's mobile sites and applications and any features of these sites and applications (NPR Mobile Services), NPR collects a device's operating system, phone model, app version, automobile make, and content preferences. NPR also collects geolocation data through the NPR Services. Geolocation data consists of general location information based on latitude and longitude, rounded to a few miles radius, or based on IP addresses. If a visitor provides specific additional consent through the authentication process for the visitor's social media account provider(s), NPR also may collect other personal information (such as age, gender or other demographic information) that the visitor has chosen to associate with his or her own social media account(s). Like all other Web servers, NPR's Web server automatically creates log files for each visitor who accesses the NPR Services. These access logs allow us to make our site more useful to our visitors. The access logs do NOT record a visitor's name, address, e-mail address, credit card numbers, or any other personally-identifying information. Rather, they contain some or all of the following information: The Internet Protocol Address (IP Address) of the machine which accessed the NPR Services. General location information (based on IP Address) Device identifier (for users of NPR Mobile Services) The date of the visit. The time of the visit. The path taken through the NPR Services, including any favorites selected by user. Other content preferences The browser being used. A list of files downloaded or viewed. The amount of time spent listening to/viewing media files. Any errors encountered. Cookies and Other Technologies NPR also uses 'cookies' to collect information. A cookie is a string of characters that can be written to a file on the user's hard drive when the user visits a web site, application or service. Only the web site, application or service that set the cookie can read it, and it can only be used as a record keeping device to store user IDs and information that the site already has. It cannot be used to read other information from the user's hard drive. NPR uses cookies to track users' activity through the NPR Services in order to improve the site/application/service architecture, to offer the user interactive features that would not be possible without them, to offer local station content or other content that may be of interest to the visitor, to recall specific information to save the user time during subsequent visits to the NPR Services, and to direct more relevant sponsorship or underwriting messages to the user while the user is on the NPR Services, based on the user's activity on the NPR Services. For example, cookies allow NPR to remember your registration information while you are logged in. Local station customization, the NPR Shop, and other interactive features also use cookies. Third party vendors that measure and analyze the use of the NPR Services for NPR, provide NPR's discussion platform and serve sponsorship messages onto the NPR Services, also use their own cookies. In addition, NPR works with third party vendors which may serve sponsorship or other messages to you on other web sites after you visit the NPR Services. These third party vendors use their own cookies to recognize you as an NPR Services visitor and to serve you sponsorship or other messages on other web sites that they believe you will find most relevant. NPR and its third party vendors also may use web beacons, alone or in conjunction with cookies. A web beacon is an electronic image, also known as a single-pixel (1x1) or clear .gif., which can be used to recognize certain information on your computer, such as cookies, the time and date a page is viewed, or a description of where API Content is placed. We may use web beacons on this site from time to time for these and other purposes. Opting Out of Cookies and Web Beacons If you wish to prevent certain or all cookies or web beacons from being set to your hard drive or device, or to clear existing cookies or web beacons from your browser's or device's cache, you may be able to disable them in your browser's preferences, although your browser might then be unable to accommodate certain functionalities on the NPR Services. In addition, if you wish to opt out of receiving personalized or interest-based sponsorship or other messages from our third party vendors and other participating companies, please visit http://networkadvertising.org/choices. Please note that if you opt out, you will still receive other types of messages that are not personalized or interest-based. Opting out is cookie-based and will only affect the specific computer and browser on which the opt out is applied. If you subsequently delete your browser cookies, you will need to opt out again. For more information about opting out of interest-based messages, visit www.aboutads.info/choices. Use of Information The use of personally-identifying information is limited to the following: managing and administering the NPR Services; responding to user messages; listing name and location (city, state and/or country) information provided by users when broadcasting or publishing User Materials; fulfillment of NPR Shop orders; offering access to NPR tours and events; contest management; editorial purposes such as contacting users for an online survey; sending NPR e-mail newsletters and other communications, including marketing and promotional communications, from NPR or NPR member stations to users who have 'opted in' to the receipt of such communications; other internal NPR or NPR member station purposes; and other purposes specified at the time the information is gathered. Any geolocation data collected through NPR Services is used to offer relevant content, including content from nearby Member stations to the visitor. NPR may contact users regarding their submissions in certain circumstances. Any information that you disclose when participating in the NPR social networking features, forums or discussions (including creating a profile or submitting a comment to a story or blog or in a discussion thread), such as your full name and any nickname, is likely to become public. This information may be posted on the NPR Services and on the platform of NPR's third party discussion services vendor. In addition, NPR, its member stations and their licensees, may use, copy, sublicense, modify, transmit, publicly perform, display, create derivative works of, host, index, cache, tag, encode, and/or adapt any User Materials, and any information contained therein, in any and all media formats or channels, whether now known or hereafter devised, including, but not limited to, the NPR Services, NPR member station web sites and services, other third party web sites and services, over the air (on radio or television), and on mobile platforms. Further, other users of the NPR Services may embed a widget or feed that allows your User Materials to appear on their personal, noncommercial web site, blog or other application, subject to conditions set forth in the Terms of Use. You also may opt in to sharing your NPR Services profile and comments with other websites and social media platforms, but only by taking action on the website for NPR's third party discussion services vendor. Any such action is governed by the terms and privacy policy of NPR's third party discussion services vendor, and not of NPR. In addition, if you send User Materials to NPR through the NPR Services, we may print the User Materials, or an excerpt from the User Materials, on the NPR Services, read them on air, or otherwise publish them in any other medium, together with your name and location (city, state and/or country) if you provide that information to us. Excluding information provided by the user when participating in the NPR social networking features, forums or discussions, or sending User Materials to NPR, which may become public as discussed above, personally-identifying information collected by NPR is not provided to outside parties except NPR member stations, NPR service vendors (such as NPR Shop fulfillment service, NPR's email list manager, and the provider of the tool that allows users to sign in using information from their account with a third party service), and other third parties when the user specifically consents to such distribution (such as the disclosure of your name to a friend when you email, send via SMS or text message, or otherwise share a story to that friend). In these circumstances, the information is provided for the sole purpose of — and only to the extent necessary for — delivering the requested goods to the user, delivering communications from NPR or NPR member stations to users who have 'opted in' to the receipt of these communications, providing services for and on behalf of NPR, or serving other internal NPR or NPR member station purposes. Visitors to the NPR Mobile Services should be aware that the wireless carrier for your mobile device or the automobile manufacturer also may collect personally-identifying information and geolocation data. Visitors should check the privacy policies of their wireless carriers and automobile manufacturers for additional information. NPR also may disclose personal information if required to do so by law or if it believes that such action is necessary to (a) comply with the law or with legal process, (b) protect against misuse or unauthorized use of the NPR Services, or (c) protect the personal safety or property of users of the NPR Services, the public or NPR and its employees. If you do not want your personally-identifying information to be collected or used for any of these purposes, please do not provide it (although if you do not provide it, you may not be able to use or participate in certain features of the NPR Services). You can also 'opt out' according to the process described below. NPR, with the assistance from time to time of its third party service vendors, uses non-identifying aggregate information to analyze use of and better design the NPR Services and to share with third parties in aggregate form only as appropriate. For example, we may tell a third party that a certain number of users accessed a particular audio stream on our Web site. We also may share non-identifying aggregate information with third party services that combine NPR's information with aggregate information from other sources to provide ratings and ranking data or other services of value to NPR. However, we will not disclose any information that could be used to identify those users. Security NPR has in place what we believe to be appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online. Credit card information provided to the NPR Shop is protected against unauthorized use by 128-bit encryption and Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) security features, which scramble your personal information so that only your browser and the NPR Shop's server can decipher it. However, no Internet, e-mail or mobile transmission is ever fully secure or error free. Because most e-mail and mobile transmissions are not encrypted, you should take special care in deciding what information you send to us via e-mail, SMS or text message, or other mobile transmission. Children Under 13: If you are under 13 years of age, please do not send any information about yourself, including your name, address or e-mail address. If we discover that we have collected any personally-identifying information from a child under the age of 13, we will remove that information from our database as soon as possible. 13-18: You must be at least 18 years old in order to Submit any User Materials on or through the NPR Services, create a public profile, participate in any online contests, or place an order on the NPR Shop. Visitors between the ages of 13 and 18 must obtain permission from their parents or guardians before registering for e-mail newsletters or other features of the NPR Services or otherwise sending any personally-identifying information. Corrections to Personal Data; Opting Out Please Contact Us to a) correct or update any personal information in the NPR database that you state is erroneous, b) opt-out of future communications from NPR, or c) request NPR to make reasonable efforts to remove your personal information from NPR's database, thereby canceling your NPR account, NPR newsletter registration and other NPR registrations. This will not necessarily remove previous public comments and other User Materials Submitted for public display on the NPR Services. The user understands that it may be impossible to delete personal information entirely because of backups and records of deletions. Acceptance of Privacy Policy Terms NPR reserves the right to change this policy. Any changes to this policy will be posted to this page as soon as reasonably possible, so please check this page periodically. Use of the NPR Services constitutes consent to any policy then in effect. Please make sure that you read NPR's Terms of Use to understand additional terms and conditions which apply to the use of the NPR Services. Links to other Sites and Services It is important to note that the NPR Services contain links to other sites, applications and services maintained by third parties that may not follow the same privacy policies as the NPR Services. For instance, clicking or tapping on a sponsorship notice or some third party logos on the NPR Services will take you to an entirely different site, application or service.

	sessionStorage.setItem("TRAIND", "Privacy Policy The purpose of the Pandora Privacy Policy is to inform our listeners about the information that we collect, how we use that information and the ways listeners can control how that information is used or shared. The entire policy can be found below. To make it a bit easier to digest our Privacy Policy, we want to highlight some key items. For information about listeners' obligations and use of Pandora® internet radio, please see our Terms of Use. You have significant control over the information that is shared with other Pandora users and the public through the privacy settings for your profile: We do not sell or give your email address to other companies for their marketing purposes without your permission. Information that you post in our community and through our social networking features is available to members of the public. We collect information about the tracks played on Pandora to make sure artists and copyright owners get paid. We must report listening information to copyright licensing agencies. These reports contain aggregated data only, and do not identify individual listeners. We collect information about the stations, tracks and artists you listen to, thumb-up, thumb-down or bookmark, and the information you provide about yourself, to personalize your Pandora experience through suggestions of music, artists and other content you may enjoy, as well as advertisements and social networking features. This information is publicly available, unless your profile is marked private. Anyone can search for, and listen to, stations that you create on Pandora. If your profile is private, then other people can find one of your stations in a search, but your profile will not be linked to that station; however, if someone enters your entire email address into our search system, they will be able to see a list of all the stations created under that email address. This summary is not the complete picture, so please read the Pandora Privacy Policy below in its entirety to learn more about the information that we collect, how we use and share this information, and your options to control how that information is used or shared. PANDORA MEDIA, INC. PRIVACY POLICY (EFFECTIVE AS OF January 30, 2012) This Privacy Policy is effective as of January 30, 2012, for Pandora Media, Inc. and its subsidiaries (Pandora, we, us or our). It applies to the United States operations for the Pandora® internet radio service (the Service) that we offer through our website located at www.pandora.com, supported mobile devices, consumer electronics devices, devices connected to or installed in an automobile, automotive sound systems and other mechanisms. We will continue to evaluate this Privacy Policy against new technologies, business practices, and our listeners' needs, and may make changes to the Privacy Policy accordingly. Please check this page periodically for updates. If we make any material changes to this Privacy Policy, we will post the updated Privacy Policy here and notify you by email or by means of a notice on our website. The types of information we collect There are several areas where you can submit information to us, and some features that automatically collect information from the listeners of our Service and visitors to our website. Information you give us: To enable you to enjoy certain features of our Service, we collect certain types of information, including personally identifiable information, during your interactions with our Service. For example, we collect information when you: Register to use our Service; Enter information in your Profile, including the people you are following and the people whom you allow to follow you; Post comments on other Pandora listeners' pages, use community and social networking features that are part of our Service, or send us email; Participate in polls, contests, or other features of the Service, or respond to offers or advertisements on the Service; and Sign up to receive email newsletters.

If you choose to subscribe to fee-based portions of the Service, you will also be asked to provide (at a minimum) your name and credit card information. Information we receive from third parties We may receive information about you from third parties and store it in our databases with other information (including personally identifiable information) that you provide to us. Some examples of these third parties are listed below: Service partners and advertisers that make features available through the Service; Service partners through whom we allow registered listeners to access the Service; Marketing companies that create professional marketing lists or sell other marketing data; Other websites or applications that you have registered to use, or that people you know have registered to use, when we allow those websites or applications to interact through the Service to provide personalized services to you.

For instance, your friends may have stored information about you in places such as their friend lists, address books, or photos on our website and other sites with which the Service interacts. We also collect your email address when people you know share a station with you, but we will not add your name to any of our mailing lists as a result of this feature. Automatic Data Collection Listening Activity: Pandora keeps track of your listening activity. Pandora uses software that is designed to ensure that artists and copyright owners receive applicable royalties for the tracks you hear. This software identifies and counts the tracks you have accessed. Pandora also collects information about stations, artists and tracks you have listened to or in which you have expressed an interest for advertising and social networking features.

Because each web browser is different, please consult the instructions provided by your web browser (typically in the help section).

 	// Pinterest Privacy Policy, http://about.pinterest.com/privacy/, retrieved 07/13/2013
	sessionStorage.setItem("TRAIND", "Privacy Policy Thank you for using Pinterest! We wrote this policy to help you understand what information we collect, how we use it, and what choices you have regarding your information. Because we're an Internet company, some of the concepts below are a little technical, but we've tried our best to explain things in a simple and clear way. We welcome your questions and comments on this policy. What information do we collect? We collect information in two ways: 1. When you give it to us or give us permission to obtain it. When you sign up for or use our products, you voluntarily give us certain information. This can include your name, profile photo, pins, comments, likes, email address you used to sign up, and any other information you provide us. If you're using Pinterest on your mobile device, you can also choose to provide us with location data. You also may give us permission to access your information in other services. For example, you may link your Facebook or Twitter account to Pinterest, which allows us to obtain information from those accounts (e.g., your friends or contacts). The information we obtain from those services often depends on your settings or their privacy policies, so be sure to check what those are. 2. We get technical information when you use our products. These days, whenever you use a website, mobile application, or other Internet service, there's certain information that almost always gets created and recorded in an automated way. The same is true when you use our products, and here are some of the types of information we collect in this way. Log Data. When you use Pinterest, our servers automatically record information about your interaction with our products (log data), including information that your browser sends whenever you visit a website or your mobile app sends when you use it to access Pinterest. This log data may include your Internet Protocol address, the address of the web page you were visiting before you came to Pinterest, browser type and settings, the date and time of your request, and how you used Pinterest. Depending on how you're accessing our products, we may use cookies (a small text file sent by your computer each time you visit our website, unique to your Pinterest account or your browser), or similar technologies to record log data. When we use cookies, we may use session cookies (that last until you close your browser) or persistent cookies (that last until you or your browser delete them). For example, we may use cookies to store your language preferences or other Pinterest settings so you don't have to set them up every time you visit Pinterest. Device Information. In addition to log data, we may also collect information about the device you're using Pinterest on, including what type of device it is, what operating system you're using, device settings, unique device identifiers, and crash data. Whether we collect some or all of this information often depends on what type of device you're using and its settings. For example, different types of information are available depending on whether you're using a Mac or a PC, or an iPhone or an Android phone. To learn more about what information your device makes available to us, please also check the policies of your device manufacturer or software provider. How do we use the information we collect? We use the information we collect to provide our products to you and make them better, develop new products, and protect Pinterest and our users. For example, we may log how often people use two different versions of a product, which can help us understand which version is better. We also use the information we collect to offer you customized content -- including helping you discover pins or boards you might like or provide you with tailored advertising. For example, if you've indicated that you're interested in cooking, we may suggest food-related pins, boards, or people. We also use the information we collect to: send you updates (such as when certain activity, like repins or comments, happens on Pinterest), newsletters, marketing materials and other information that may be of interest to you. For example, depending on your email notification settings, we may send you weekly updates that include pins you may like. You can decide to stop getting these updates by updating your account settings (or through other settings we may provide). Respond to your questions or comments. The information we collect may be personally identifiable (meaning it can be used to specifically identify you as a unique person) or non-personally identifiable (meaning it can't be used to specifically identify you). We use both types of information, and combinations of both types, as described above. We may use or store information wherever Pinterest does business, including countries outside your own. What choices do you have about your information? Our goal is to give you simple and meaningful choices over your information. If you have a Pinterest account, many of the choices you have on Pinterest are built directly in to the product or your account settings. For example, you can: Access and change information in your profile page at any time, and choose whether your profile page is available to search engines; Link or unlink your Pinterest account from an account on another service (e.g., Facebook or Twitter). For some services (like Facebook), you can also choose whether or not to publish your activity on Pinterest to that service. Create or be added to a secret board. Secret boards are visible to you and other participants in the board, and any participant may choose to make the contents of the board available to anyone else. For example, another participant may invite someone else to the board, make the board available to an app they use to view Pinterest, or even just take an image from the board and email it to their friends. For more information about secret boards, please visit our Help Center. Close your account at any time. When you close your account, we'll deactivate it and remove your pins and boards from Pinterest. We may retain archived copies of your information as required by law or for legitimate business purposes (including to help address fraud and spam). In addition to the examples above, we offer other choices that you can learn more about in our Help Center. You may have choices available to you through the device or software you use to access Pinterest. For example: The browser you use may provide you with the ability to control cookies or other types of local data storage; Your mobile device may provide you with choices around how and whether location or other data is shared with us. To learn more about these choices, please see the information provided by the device or software provider. How do we share the information we collect? Pinterest is a tool people use to find their inspirations, make them a reality, and inspire others in the process. When you create public boards and pins, anyone can view them. You may also provide us with profile page information that that anyone can view. The other limited instances where we may share your personal information include: When we have your consent. This includes sharing information with other services (like Facebook or Twitter) when you’ve chosen to link to your Pinterest account to those services or publish your activity on Pinterest to them. For example, you can choose to publish your pins to Facebook or Twitter. We may employ third party companies or individuals to process personal information on our behalf based on our instructions and in compliance with this Privacy Policy. For example, we may share data with a security consultant to help us get better at identifying spam or with our accountants to make sure we’re keeping the books right. In addition, some of the information we request may be collected by third party providers on our behalf. For more information about the providers we use, please see our Help Center. If we believe that disclosure is reasonably necessary to comply with a law, regulation or legal request; to protect the safety, rights, or property of the public, any person, or Pinterest; or to detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues. We may engage in a merger, acquisition, bankruptcy, dissolution, reorganization, or similar transaction or proceeding that involves the transfer of the information described in this Policy. We may also share aggregated or non-personally identifiable information with our partners or others. For example, we may tell a business using Pinterest how many people repinned something they shared, or the percentage of people who click a on pin after viewing it. Our Policy on Children’s Information Pinterest is not directed to children under 13. If you learn that your minor child has provided us with personal information without your consent, please contact us. How do we make changes to this policy? We may change this policy from time to time, and if we do we’ll post any changes on this page. If you continue to use Pinterest after those changes are in effect, you agree to the revised policy. If the changes are significant, we may provide more prominent notice or obtain your consent as required by law. Pinterest is a tool for collecting and organizing the things that inspire you. We are located in sunny San Francisco, California.");

	sessionStorage.setItem("TRAIND", "reddit privacy policy effective may 15, 2013 your privacy is a core reddit value. we strive to create a policy worthy of you. 1 We take protecting your privacy seriously, and we want you to understand exactly how and why we use your information. This document is our Privacy Policy, which describes what information we collect and what it's used for. It applies to all interactions with reddit.com, including content posted through iReddit, and interactions with our site through the button and widget. However, other services we own – such as redditgifts – and loosely affiliated but independent services (for instance, radio reddit) have their own terms, and you should review them on each service's respective website. 2 Please read this Privacy Policy carefully. Your use of and/or registration with reddit will constitute your agreement to our policy. If you cannot agree to the terms and conditions set forth below, please do not use our services. Additionally, our Privacy Policy is part of our User Agreement, and by using the site you agree to both. about this policy 3 reddit is an open platform that allows you to communicate about anything you want on any topic you want. We collect some information in order for you to have an account you can use to participate on the site, and other information that is necessary to make the service work. Our goal in developing our privacy practices is to allow your participation to remain as anonymous as you choose and we don’t sell or profit from the information you share with us. 4 We do take efforts to make sure the platform keeps working. This includes using your information, where necessary, to stop spam and gaming and other activities that violate the user agreement. We also share your information when we are legally required to do so. Please read this privacy policy carefully. It describes what information we collect, how it is used, and when it is shared so you can make smart decisions about how you use reddit! We think it strikes a good balance and respects you – our users – who make this whole thing possible. Let us know what you think. what information we collect registration information 5 When you create an account, you are required to provide a username and password, and may opt to provide an email address. We also log, and retain indefinitely, the IP address from which the account is initially created. post, comment and messaging data 6 The posts and comments you make on reddit are not private, even if made to a subreddit not readily accessible to the public. This means that, by default, they are not deleted from our servers – ever – and will still be accessible after your account is deleted. However, we only save the most recent version of comments and posts, so your previous edits, once overwritten, are no longer available. 7 Your messages are generally only viewable by the parties involved, but they may be accessed internally as needed for community support. Moreover, we keep a complete log of all messages sent on our service, even when both parties later delete their accounts. 8 reddit stores the IP addresses associated with specific posts, comments, and private messages for 90 days after they are made or sent. reddit gold 9 If you choose to upgrade to reddit gold, this status will be stored on your profile, along with the transaction number associated with the payment. However, reddit does not handle or have access to any of your payment information. For questions about how this information is stored and used, please read our third party partners’ privacy policies. log data 10 Log data is certain information that is automatically collected by our systems when you visit reddit, including the type of software used to access the site (browser, operating system), the address of the external or internal page that referred you, and your IP address. This information is recorded even if you are logged out of your account. It will be deleted from our servers after 90 days. other information related to your account 11 As you interact with reddit as an accountholder, we save certain information about these interactions and your preferences: subscriptions, preferred language, all languages you see content in, accumulated karma, voting data, and date of last login. You may also opt to add flair to decorate your profile, and this will be stored as well. how we use or disclose collected information our use of your information is limited to improving your experience 12 It takes a lot of work to keep our site running and prevent abuse, and we sometimes use your data in order to facilitate this. Your information is used internally only where necessary to provide our services. For instance, we keep IP addresses for 90 days in order to investigate issues with our site, track and block suspected spammers, and otherwise maintain the integrity of the community. your private information is never for sale 13 This means that we will only share your personal data with your consent, and after letting you know what information will be shared and with whom, unless it is otherwise permitted in this policy. While advertisers may target their ads to the topic of a given subreddit, we do not sell or otherwise give access to any information collected about our users to any third party. 14 Anonymous, aggregated information that cannot be linked back to an individual user may be made available to third parties. reddit will not disclose your information unless required by law 15 We may disclose – or preserve for future disclosure – your information if we believe, after due consideration, that doing so is reasonably necessary to comply with a law, regulation, or valid legal process. If we are going to release your information, we will do our best to provide you with notice in advance via reddit's private messaging system unless we are prohibited by court order from doing so (e.g., an order under 18 U.S.C. § 2705(b)). your information may be disclosed by us in an emergency or to keep our services running 16 Other extraordinary circumstances may require disclosure: we may also disclose your information when we believe it's necessary to prevent imminent and serious bodily harm to a person; to address fraud, security, or spam; or to protect our rights or property. cookie policy 17 Cookies are small data files placed on your computer by websites you visit in order to help them remember certain information about you. At reddit, we set only a few cookies for tracking user preferences, authentication, and collecting anonymous analytics data. Additionally, our advertising partners set cookies. Each of these uses is described in greater detail below. preference cookies 18 If you are logged out, reddit will place a simple cookie to remember if you indicate you would like to view over 18 content, or if you set a language preference. Additionally, if you vote an advertisement up or down, our third-party advertising partner, Adzerk, will set a cookie to remember your ad preferences. authentication cookies 19 When you log into your account, reddit will place a cookie for the sole purpose of creating this session. It contains your user id and hashed authentication information. analytics cookies 20 We use a tool called Google Analytics to help us understand how users interact with our website. It tells us aggregate usage and traffic information, such as how the site was accessed, how long visitors stayed, and the number of first-time visitors to the site. By knowing how people use the site, we can make it better. To learn more about Google Analytics and how it uses your data, please visit http://www.google.com/analytics/learn/privacy.html. advertising cookies 21 We partner with Adzerk to show our users third party ads. 22 Some cookies may be placed during the provision of this service pursuant to Adzerk's privacy policy. disabling cookies 23 Most browsers include an option to clear existing cookies or reject new ones. However, if you do this, portions of the reddit website may not function as intended. account deletion 24 You may choose to delete your reddit account at any time. The usernames associated with deleted accounts remain unavailable for others to use, and your public profile is no longer visible to users of the site. However, the posts and content you made during your tenure as a reddit user will not be automatically deleted as part of the account removal process, though your username will be publicly disassociated with all posts. third party sites 25 Certain third party sites may offer users the option to log in using their reddit id (for example, redditgifts). This option is only an authentication tool and does not transmit any new personal information to reddit, or give reddit access to details of subsequent actions taken on these sites. data security 26 reddit will make every effort to secure any private information submitted to us by our users. However, no data transmission over the internet is completely secure, so we cannot guarantee the absolute security of this data. You use the service at your own risk, and are responsible for taking reasonable measures to secure your account (such as carefully maintaining the secrecy of your password). international visitors 27 reddit is a San Francisco, California-based company whose servers are housed in the United States. All personal information we collect from our international users is transferred to the United States and processed according to US law. 28 reddit complies with the U.S.-EU Safe Harbor Framework and the U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information from European Union member countries and Switzerland. reddit has certified that it adheres to the Safe Harbor Privacy Principles of notice, choice, onward transfer, security, data integrity, access, and enforcement.

HOW DOES SKYPE USE THIS INFORMATION AND FOR WHAT PURPOSE? Our primary purpose in collecting information is to provide you with a safe, smooth, efficient, and customized experience. Skype collects and uses, or has third party service providers acting on Skype’s behalf collecting and using, personal data relating to you, as permitted or necessary to: provide internet communication, video sharing and other products in particular to convey the communications and videos you and others make by means of the Skype software and/or the Skype products; take, process or deliver orders made via our websites, invoice you or notify you of the status of your order; display updates about your recent activity using the Qik products or connections to other Qik users; provide other services for you (as described when we collect the information); provide you with customer support and troubleshoot problems; compare information for accuracy; inform you about service updates and faults; request feedback or participation in on-line surveys; resolve disputes; verify your identity; customize, measure, and improve Skype software and websites, as well as other Microsoft products and services improve our search functionality and help you find and contact other Skype users more easily and accurately; organise and carry out Skype’s marketing or promotional operations/offers, contests, games and similar events; and protect your and Skype’s interests, including in particular to enforce our Terms of Service and prevent and fight against fraud, (together, the Purposes). 3. OUR DISCLOSURE OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION Except as provided below, Skype will not sell, rent, trade or otherwise transfer any personal and/or traffic data or communications content outside of Microsoft and its controlled subsidiaries and affiliates without your explicit permission, unless it is obliged to do so under applicable laws or by order of the competent authorities. Please note that information that you voluntarily make public in your user profile, or which you disclose on forums, discussions boards or by posting comments will be publicly available and viewable by others. Skype may disclose personal information to respond to legal requirements, exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims, to protect Skype’s interests, fight against fraud and to enforce our policies or to protect anyone's rights, property, or safety. In order to provide you with Skype products you have requested, Skype may sometimes, if necessary, share your personal and traffic data with Skype’s group companies, carriers, partner service providers and/or agents. For example the PSTN-VoIP gateway provider, WiFi access services providers, distributors of Skype software and/or Skype products, and/or the third party banking organizations or other providers of payment, email delivery, analytical services, customer support, or hosting services. Skype will always require these third parties to take appropriate organizational and technical measures to protect your personal data and traffic data and to observe the relevant legislation. Some Skype products may be co-branded and offered together with or via a partner company. If you register for or use such products, you consent to both Skype and the partner company’s use of personal data collected in connection with the co-branded product. Skype may offer its products in connection with other websites or services or may team with other online services to give you the combined results of both products/services or additional services and benefits. To determine whether you would benefit from the combined offer, if you have provided your consent, Skype may match your email address, and email addresses of your contacts against email addresses you have provided to the third party website/service provider. If you are a member of the Skype Manager, detailed information about the activity on your Skype account including traffic data and details of your purchases and downloads may be accessed by your Skype Manager Administrator if you have agreed to such access. You can withdraw your agreement at any time by changing the settings on your account page on www.skype.com. If you provide personal data including your name and job title to be included in the Skype Manager directory, you acknowledge that such data may be viewed by other members of the Skype Manager. If you leave a voicemail for another Skype user, your voicemail message may be transferred to a third party service provider (where the Skype contact you are trying to reach has signed up to receive voicemails by text message), and will be converted to text. The conversion process may in exceptional cases, require access by analysts. By using the voicemail product, you consent to the processing of your voicemail message by Skype and its service provider. Skype, Skype's local partner, or the operator or company facilitating your communication may provide personal data, communications content and/or traffic data to an appropriate judicial, law enforcement or government authority lawfully requesting such information. Skype will provide reasonable assistance and information to fulfill this request and you hereby consent to such disclosure. Information that is collected by or sent to Skype and/or Microsoft may be stored and processed in the United States or any other country in which Microsoft or its affiliates, subsidiaries, or service providers maintain facilities. In this regard, or for purposes of sharing or disclosing data in accordance with this article 4, Skype reserves the right to transfer information outside of your country. By using Skype software, Skype's websites or Skype products you consent to any such transfer of information outside of your country. Microsoft abides by the U.S.-EU Safe Harbor Framework and the U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of data from the European Economic Area, and Switzerland. To learn more about the Safe Harbor program, and to view our certification, please visit www.export.gov/safeharbor. As Microsoft continues to develop its business, Microsoft might sell or buy subsidiaries or business units. In any such transactions in which Skype or substantially all of its assets are acquired by a third party, personal information of Skype users will generally be one of the transferred business assets. We reserve the right to include your personal information in any such transfer to a third party. 4. WHAT ARE COOKIES AND GIFS HOW DOES SKYPE USE THEM? Key Points By using Skype’s websites and/or software you are giving your consent to the use of cookies. You can choose to reject cookies at any time, either by changing your browser settings (if your browser permits) or by ceasing to use Skype’s websites and/or software or by using the applicable opt-out functions. You should be aware that certain features are only available through the use of cookies and if you choose not to accept cookies, such features may not be available to you. 4.1 What are Cookies and GIFs? 4.1.1. Cookies Cookies are small files containing a string of characters (text) that are sent to your browser from a website’s server. The cookie may contain a unique identifier but it does not contain personally identifiable information such as your name or email address. Skype may use cookies when you visit its websites, use Skype’s software or visit other websites where Skype serves advertisements. The browser of the Skype software client or your Internet browser stores the cookie on your computer's hard drive and this may be accessed by the website during your next visit. Other websites may also send cookies to your browser but your browser will not allow those websites to see Skype’s cookie data. A typical Skype cookie might look something like this: SC=LC=en:CCY=EUR:CC=UK:TZ=+1:VER=0/1.3.0.13/:TS=1105405660:TM=103841368 SC stands for Skype Cookie (cookie name) LC is the language preference for our website CCY is the currency preference for our website CC is a country code TZ is timezone VER is the Skype software client version that the user is known to be running TS is when the cookie was set TM is when the cookie was modified 4.1.2. Gifs Skype web pages and client interfaces may include clear gifs, also known as web-beacons and tracking pixels. Gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, which are used to count your visits to the page (but which do not retain any personally identifiable information). In addition, Skype uses clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to let us know which emails have been opened and acted upon. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns. 4.2 What type of Cookies does Skype use? Skype uses session cookies, persistent cookies and local shared objects (flash cookies). Session cookies are temporary cookies, or unique identifiers associated with your browser for the duration of your visit to Skype’s websites or area of the Skype software client. Once you close your browser, the session cookie ID will disappear and information about your visit is not retained. Persistent Cookies remain on your browser even after you close it and may be used by your browser on subsequent visits to the website. Local Shared Objects or ‘Flash Cookies’ are cookies written with Adobe flash technology. These cookies are saved on your computer in the same way as other cookies but they cannot be managed at browser level in the same way. 4.3 How Skype uses Cookies Skype uses its own cookies for a variety of purposes, including to: 1. recognize you when you sign in and understand how you arrived at our website, so we can make sure that we provide you with relevant customer content and information. For example: if you arrived at our website by clicking on a link to hear about US subscription packages, we can make sure you see content relevant to those offers; we can recognize your time zone so that your call lists are accurately displayed; if your last purchase included VAT, we can make sure you are always provided with a VAT inclusive price; if your cookie was set a long time ago, we know you are not a new user and we will not show you content intended for new users, such as ‘how to use Skype’ pages; 2. remember your chosen preferences, such as: the language you choose to see our website in; the currency you wish to see our prices in; 3. fight against fraud; 4. inform Skype about the version of the Skype software client you are using so that we can provide you with new software updates and direct you to the relevant help sections; 5. enable you to access your account and account services through the Skype Software client; 6. provide internal and customer analytics and gain statistics and metrics about our websites, such as total number of visitors and page views; 7. monitor the effectiveness and performance of our advertising and marketing campaigns and carry out research in order to help us to improve our products and websites; 8. initiate security measures such as ‘time-out’ when you have not logged into your account service area for a period of time; 9. populate your Skype client with one of your Skype contacts’ information, where this contact invited you to join Skype; 10. deliver video content to you; 11. provide Skype ads most relevant to you when you visit other sites that display Skype ads. 4.4 Third Party Cookies In addition to Skype’s cookies, Skype’s analytics, ad-serving and affiliate partners may set cookies and access cookies on your computer, when you are using the Skype software client or visiting a Skype website. 4.4.1 Analytics Skype uses analytics partners, including Omniture, Google Analytics, and Flurry Analytics, to gather anonymous statistical and analytical information about how users use Skype websites and software clients. For example, these partners gather and aggregate data on page views and clicks on our sites, the search engines and keywords used to find our sites, links accessed from our sites, error and crash information about our clients, and similar information. These analytics are not used to track your journey to other websites or to identify you. 4.4.2 Advertising The advertisements of Skype appearing on third party websites and the advertisements of third parties appearing in the Skype software, products and on third party websites are delivered to you by Microsoft Advertising or other carefully selected ad serving partners (“Ad Serving Partners”). Skype and its Ad Serving Partners may use non-personally identifiable information that you have provided in your Skype profile or otherwise provided to Skype, such as your age, gender, language and country of residence, as well as information about your relationship with Skype’s websites, software, and products, in order to provide advertisements likely to be of greater interest to you and to help us measure and improve the performance of our advertising campaigns. Skype and our Ad Serving Partners may use cookies and/or web-beacons (Gifs) to collect this information. 4.4.3. Affiliates Skype’s affiliate network program partner allows third parties to introduce people to Skype. Our affiliates may send cookies to your computer to allow them to receive information (a) when you click on a Skype related link on one of our affiliate partner sites, and/or (b) when you make a purchase on Skype’s website, for the purpose of paying commission to the affiliate partner. If you re-visit Skype’s site directly, our affiliate network program partner can recognize you and reward the third-party affiliate partner site that referred you to our site. These cookies are not within Skype’s control and for more information please visit our affiliate network partner Commission Junction’s site at: http://www.cj.com/privacy 4.4.4. Other Third Party Content Sometimes, Skype’s websites may include widgets or embedded video content from third parties such as YouTube. When you view this content or use this widget, you may be accepting cookies from these websites. These cookies are not within our control and you should check with the relevant third party site for more information. 4.5 Your Choices about Cookies We don’t recommend that you restrict or block cookies as this may impact on the functionality of our websites and products. However, if you choose to do so, please see the options available to you below. You can also find comprehensive information about cookies at www.aboutcookies.org. 4.5.1 Browser Cookies The Help option on the toolbar of most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, how to delete cookies or how to disable cookies altogether. Skype "
	+ "software browser cookies can be disabled by: accessing the File menu from your Skype software client toolbar, choosing the Privacy option and un-checking the ‘Allow Skype Browser Cookies’ box. 4.5.2 Local Shared Objects (Flash Cookies) You can manage the usage of flash cookies via http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager.html. You may also manage flash cookies through your browser depending on how recent the version of Internet Explorer (or other browser) and media player you are using. Please also visit the Adobe website at http://kb2.adobe.com/cps/526/52697ee8.html 4.5.3 Analytics To opt out of Omniture analytic cookies, please visit: https://smetrics.skype.com/optout.html To opt out of Google Analytics cookies, please visit: http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout 5. YOUR ADVERTISING CHOICES 5.1 Third Party Advertisements Some Skype software clients may enable third-party advertisements provided by Microsoft Advertising. In order to provide ads of greater interest to you, these ads may be targeted based on non-personally identifiable Skype profile information (including profile information from linked LiveID accounts), such as age, gender, country of residence, and language preference, as well as other information Microsoft Advertising collects outside the Skype software client. For instance, Microsoft Advertising may utilize the same browser cookies set by Microsoft websites to enhance targeting within the Skype software client. Except for the modern Skype client running on Windows 8, you may opt-out of Microsoft targeted ads in any Skype software client that enables targeted ads by visiting the privacy menu in the Skype software client toolbar. If you opt-out, you will still receive advertisements based on your country of residence, language preference, and IP address location, but other targeting information will not be used. For the modern Skype client running on Windows 8, you may opt-out of receiving targeted ads from Microsoft Advertising through your browser by visiting http://choice.live.com/advertisementchoice, or the NAI or DAA sites described below. For more information about how Microsoft Advertising collects and uses information, please see the Microsoft Advertising Privacy Supplement. In some instances, Microsoft Advertising may facilitate the placement of advertisements in Skype software client by other online advertising networks. These companies currently include, but are not limited to: 24/7 Real Media, aCerno,Inc, AdBlade, AdConion, AdFusion, Advertising.com, AppNexus, Bane Media, Brand.net, CasaleMedia, Collective Media, Fox Interactive, Interclick, Millennial, ROI Media, Social Media, SpecificMedia, Tribal Fusion, ValueClick, Yahoo!, YuMe and Zumobi. If you have opted-out of targeted ads in the Skype client as outlined above, Skype will not pass any profile information to such advertising providers with the ad request. However, because these third parties may place cookies on your computer that facilitate their own targeting, the Skype opt-out mechanism described above will not necessarily prevent ad targeting by these companies. These companies may offer you a way to opt-out of ad targeting based on their cookies. You may find more information by clicking on the company names above and following the links to the Web sites of each company. Many of them are also members of the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) or the Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA), which each provide a simple way to opt-out of ad targeting from participating companies. 5.2 Skype Advertisements You may also choose to opt-out of the use of your non-personally identifiable profile information in connection with Skype's advertising efforts on third party websites by clicking on the following link: http://media.skype.com/optout_confirmation.html. If you choose to opt-out, Skype's advertisements will still be delivered to you but information about your relationship with Skype's websites or the Skype software will not be used for this purpose. 6. YOUR USER PROFILE Your user profile is the information provided by you at registration or later which is displayed in your Skype profile in the Skype software client, in the Skype search directory and on your personal details page in your account on www.skype.com. It may include your Skype username, full name, address, telephone and mobile numbers, gender, date of birth, country, language, “about me” page URL, and any other information that you decide to make available. You can access your user profile from the “Skype” menu in the Skype software client or from your account on www.skype.com in order to view, correct or complete information, remove non-mandatory information; and to see the privacy settings associated with your profile information. If you use the Qik products, you will have a Qik user profile. A username and optional first name and last name is displayed when you stream videos, upload videos, or send messages. Based on your privacy settings, any content that you submit to Qik may be redistributed through the Internet and other media channels and may be viewed by the general public. You can access your profile from your account on www.qik.com in order to view, correct or complete information, remove non-mandatory information; and you can change your sharing settings from the settings menu in the Qik software application. 7. LINKED WEBSITES AND THIRD PARTY APPLICATIONS Skype websites may contain links that will let you leave Skype's website and access another website. Linked websites are not under the control of Skype and these websites have different privacy policies. The Skype Privacy Policy applies solely to personal information that is acquired on the websites or through your use of the Skype software, Skype products and/or your relationship with Skype, so Skype urges you to be careful when you enter any personal information online. Skype accepts no responsibility or liability for these other websites. If you use any extras, plug-ins or third party applications together with the Skype software or use any third party applications or products that incorporate or embed the Skype software (“Applications”), the provider of such Applications may obtain access to certain personal information about you. Skype does not and cannot control how the provider of Applications may use any personal information connected in connection with such Applications. Please ensure that you review any privacy policies or other terms applicable to the use of such Application before installation. 8. HOW DOES SKYPE PROTECT YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION? Skype will take appropriate organizational and technical measures to protect the personal data and traffic data provided to it or collected by it with due observance of the applicable obligations and exceptions under the relevant legislation. Your personal and traffic data can only be accessed by authorized employees of Microsoft or its affiliates, subsidiaries or service providers who need to have access to this data in order to be able to fulfill their given duties. Skype may use automated scanning within Instant Messages and SMS to (a) identify suspected spam and/or (b) identify URLs that have been previously flagged as spam, fraud, or phishing links. In limited instances, Skype may capture and manually review instant messages or SMS in connection with Spam prevention efforts. Skype may, in its sole discretion, block or prevent delivery of suspected Spam, and remove suspicious links from messages. 9. PERSONAL DATA OF FRIENDS You may be interested in inviting your friends to join Skype. In the event you wish to use Skype's referral service, you will be directed to a webpage and will have the possibility of adding one or more email addresses in an online form. The information entered in this form, will only be used for the purposes of automatically generating an email message to these potential Skype users. By entering your friend’s email address you are confirming that your friend has consented to the supply of their details. Skype may identify you as the person who has made the referral in the invitation sent to your friend and will include your name, email address and/or phone number in such invitation. 10. CONTACTING YOU Skype may from time to time ask you to provide information on your experiences which will be used to measure and improve quality. You are at no time under any obligation to provide any of such data. Any and all information which is voluntarily submitted in feedback forms on the website or any survey that you take part in is used for the purposes of reviewing this feedback and improving the Skype software, and Skype and other Microsoft products and websites. Skype may contact you to send you messages about faults and service issues. Further, Skype reserves the right to use email, the Skype software or SMS to notify you of any eventual claims related to your use of Skype software, the Skype websites and/or Skype products, including without limitation claims of violation of third party rights. Skype may send you alerts by email or SMS to notify you when someone has tried to contact you. Skype may also use email, SMS or the Skype software to keep you up to date with news about the Skype software and Skype products that you have purchased and/or to inform you about other Skype products or other Skype related information. You can opt-out of the receipt of alerts and/or promotional (a) emails by clicking the ‘unsubscribe’ link on the email that you receive or by changing your notification settings on your account page on www.skype.com; and (b) SMS by following the instructions on the SMS that you receive. If you have registered for or use co-branded Skype products, the emails or SMS that you receive may be from our partner company, acting on Skype’s behalf. 11. HOW CAN YOU ACCESS OR AMEND YOUR PERSONAL DATA? You have the right to access and, where relevant, to amend your personal information. Some of your information may be viewed or edited online by signing into your account page on www.skype.com or www.qik.com. We will respond to requests to view, correct, complete or remove your personal information within a reasonable period of time and upon verification of your identity. Skype will use all reasonable endeavours to accommodate requests to delete personal information unless it is required to be retained by law or for lawful business purposes. However, please note that due to the technical nature of the peer to peer network, it can sometimes take up to two weeks before your Skype ID disappears completely from the peer to peer network. Your details may still appear in the search directory during this time. 12. HOW LONG IS YOUR PERSONAL DATA KEPT BY SKYPE? Skype will retain your information for as long as is necessary to: (1) fulfill any of the Purposes (as defined in article 2 of this Privacy Policy) or (2) comply with applicable legislation, regulatory requests and relevant orders from competent courts. Retention of Instant Messages, Voicemail Messages, and Video Messages (Skype internet communications software application only) Your instant messaging (IM), voicemail, and video message content (collectively “messages”) may be stored by Skype (a) to convey and synchronize your messages and (b) to enable you to retrieve the messages and history where possible. Depending on the message type, messages are generally stored by Skype for a maximum of between 30 and 90 days unless otherwise permitted or required by law. This storage facilitates delivery of messages when a user is offline and to help sync messages between user devices.  For IM, if you have linked your Skype and Microsoft accounts, you may have the option to choose to store your full IM history for a longer period. In that case, your IMs may be stored in your Outlook.com Messaging folder until you manually delete them. For Video messages, you may also choose to store messages for an extended period if the sender is a Premium Member. Skype will take appropriate technical and security measures to protect your information. By using this product, you consent to the storage of your IM, voicemail, and video message communications as described above. 13.

Slashdot Media is committed to protecting the privacy of users of the Sites. This Privacy Statement applies to each of the Sites and describes the information Slashdot Media collects about users and how that information may be used. Slashdot Media complies with the United States (“US”)/European Union (“EU”) and US/Swiss Safe Harbor frameworks as set forth by the US Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use and retention of personal data from European Union member countries and Switzerland. Slashdot Media has certified that it adheres to the Safe Harbor Privacy Principles of notice, choice, onward transfer, security, data integrity, access, and enforcement. We self-certify compliance with To learn more about the Safe Harbor program, and to view Slashdot Media’s certification, please visit http://export.gov/safeharbor For additional information about what to do if you have questions or concerns about our Safe Harbor program, please see the enforcement section below. Slashdot Media reserves the right to update and change this Privacy Statement from time to time. If Slashdot Media makes material changes to its privacy practices, a notice will be posted on this web page. Each time a user uses the Sites, the current version of the Privacy Statement applies. Accordingly, a user should check the date of this Privacy Statement (which appears at the top) and review for any changes since the last version. If a user does not agree to the Privacy Statement, the user should not use the Sites. Slashdot Media has been awarded TRUSTe’s Privacy Seal signifying that this privacy policy and practices have been reviewed by TRUSTe for compliance with TRUSTe’s program requirements including transparency, accountability and choice regarding the collection and use of your personal information. TRUSTe’s mission, as an independent third party, is to accelerate online trust among consumers and organizations globally through its leading privacy trustmark and innovative trust solutions. If you have questions or complaints regarding our privacy policy or practices, please contact us at privacy@dice.com.  If you are not satisfied with our response you can contact TRUSTe here. The TRUSTe program covers information that is collected through the Sites. NOTICE Slashdot Media provides this Privacy Statement to make users aware of Slashdot Media privacy practices, and of the choices a user may make about the way the user’s information is collected and used. Children Users represent they are of legal age to create binding and financial obligations for any liability users may incur as a result of their use of the Sites. The Sites are not directed to children under the age of 13. Slashdot Media does not knowingly collect, or wish to obtain, personally identifiable information from children. If Slashdot Media becomes aware that a user is under the age of 13 and has provided personally identifiable information without prior verifiable parental or guardian consent, it will remove user’s personally identifiable information from its files. What information Slashdot Media collects Slashdot Media may collect three types of information from users of Sites: “personally identifiable information”, “device information” about the device you are using to access our site, and “aggregate information.” Personally identifiable information is any piece of information which can potentially be used to uniquely identify, contact, or locate a user of the Sites (such as name, email address, postal address, telephone number). Device information is information about the device and its attributes (such as information about how your browser is configured, whether your device has enabled cookies, its Flash settings, the device’s identification number and other characteristics about the device); it also may be personally identifiable information in cases where it is associated with the name or other identifier for a Site user.  We use device information for purposes such as enhancing the user experience. Aggregate information is non-personally identifiable/anonymous information about users of the Sites (such as frequency of visits to Sites, Site pages most frequently accessed browser type).  Aggregate information also may include pages visited along with any navigation and in-page interactions used during each visit. In-page interactions monitored include: clicks and selections, mouse movement, page scrolling, and form fields focused on (specific keystrokes entered into each field are not collected).  Aggregate information is used in a collective manner and no single person can be identified by that compiled information. We also use Omniture, comScore and Google Analytics for aggregation and analysis of session information. If you would like to opt-out of the aggregation and analysis of your session information by Omniture, please see the section about browser cookies below for information about how you can control browser cookies. If you would like to opt-out of information collection by comScore, please visit: http://www.scorecardresearch.com/preferences.aspx. If you would like to opt-out of Google Analytics, Google has developed a tool that works with major internet browsers to permit you to opt-out.  For more information and install their opt-out tool please visit: http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout. If you opt-out of Google Analytics, and Omniture monitoring, we still may collect some device and aggregate information ourselves through log files as discussed below or in connection with our forms. On the Sites, users may order products or services, and register to receive materials. Personally identifiable information collected on the Sites includes community forum content, diaries, profiles, photographs, name, unique identifiers (e.g., passwords), contact and billing information (e.g., email address, postal address, telephone, fax), and transaction information. In order to tailor Slashdot Media’s subsequent communications to users and continuously improve the Sites’ products and services, Slashdot Media may also ask users to provide information regarding their interests, demographics, experience with its products, and detailed contact preferences. Social Network Login   If you chose to use third-party social networking sites, such as Facebook or Twitter, to log into one of our sites that offers that login feature, we may collect information, such as your basic profile information, gender, age, interests, and other demographic and geographical information, from the social networking site you use to interact with our site.  If you do not want to share information from your social networking account with us you can either decline to use these features or check your social networking site’s current privacy setting options to see what options they provide for limiting disclosures when you use login sharing features. This privacy policy will apply to our use of information collected about you through these offerings. We do not control the privacy practices of your social networking sites. As a result, we want you to be aware that when you use these offerings you may be providing information to both us and the social networking site, and you should review your social networking site’s privacy policy to be sure that you know how it will use any data that it collects.  Similarly, if you choose to post content from our site through your social networking accounts, you will be sharing information about your activities with your social networking provider.   Web beacons Slashdot Media uses web beacons from time to time. Such web beacons may be provided by Slashdot Media’s third party advertising companies to help manage and optimize Slashdot Media’s online advertising. To opt out of targeted advertising delivered by Network Advertising Initiative members, click here: http://www.networkadvertising.org/consumer/opt_out.asp  A web beacon is a string of code that provides a method for delivering a graphic image on a web page or in an email message for the purpose of transferring data, or determining how many times a specific web page has been viewed. Web beacons enable Slashdot Media to recognize a browser’s cookie when a browser visits a Site, and to learn which banner ads bring users to each Site. For example, when a user visits a web page, the code for the page may include instructions to go to another server to gather a single pixel graphic image. Web beacons are not placed on a user’s computer. Cookies Slashdot Media uses cookies on the Sites. A “browser” or “HTTP” cookie is a unique text file that may be used for data analysis, and enables a web site to tailor information presented to a user based on a user’s browsing program. Slashdot Media may use browser cookies to personalize a user’s pages at a Site or Sites, to remember a user when the user registers for products or services, for fraud prevention, or to track visits to a Site or across our Sites. If a user does not want Slashdot Media or its partners to deploy browser cookies in the user’s browser when the user visits the Sites, the user may set the browser to reject cookies or to notify the user when a web site tries to place cookies in the browser program. Rejecting cookies may affect a user’s ability to use some of the products, features, functions, or services on our Sites. Our Sites also may use local shared objects, also known as “Flash cookies” to store your preferences or display content based upon what you view on our website to personalize your visit. Flash cookies are different from “browser” cookies because of the amount of, type of, and how data is stored. Cookie management tools provided by your browser will not remove Flash cookies. To learn how to manage privacy and storage settings for Flash cookies, including how to delete Flash cookies, click here for additional information: http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager.html#117118. The ads appearing on the Sites may be delivered to visitors by third parties, such as Google. The third party advertising technology that Slashdot Media uses on the Sites uses information derived from a user’s visits to the Sites to target advertising within the Sites. In addition, Slashdot Media’s advertisers may use other third party advertising technology to target advertising on the Sites. In the course of serving advertisements to the Sites, our partners may place or recognize a unique cookie on a user’s browser. Information about users’ visits to the Sites, such as the number of times users have viewed an ad (but not users’ names, addresses, or other personally identifiable information), are used to serve ads to visitors. The use of cookies enables our partners to serve ads to users based on such user’s visit to Slashdot Media’s sites and other sites on the Internet. As with other cookies, and consistent with Slashdot Media’s policy on cookies stated above, the user may block or delete such cookies from the user’s drive or memory. For more information about Google, Google’s use of cookies, and how to “opt out” of Google’s email/information lists, please click here: http://www.google.com/privacy_ads.html. As noted in the Web Beacon discussion above, users also can opt-out of receiving these types of targeted network advertisements from many advertising networks by visiting the National Advertising Initiative website identified above. For a more detailed discussion, please see Slashdot Media’s Cookies and Opt-Out Choices Statement. Log files Slashdot Media web servers may automatically log aggregate information, such as a user’s IP address, domain name, browser type, date and time of access, and other log file data. This information may be used to analyze trends or administer the Sites. With respect to SourceForge.net, Slashdot Media contracts with third party mirror providers, who deliver integrated communications services, including Internet access services, to deploy mirrors of downloads in order to make file downloading via SourceForge.net faster and more convenient. The logging practices and other policies of mirror sites may differ from those set forth in this Privacy Statement. How Slashdot Media uses the information collected Slashdot Media may use the personally identifiable information a user submits for any purposes related to Slashdot Media’s business, including, but not limited to: To understand a user’s needs and create content that is relevant to the user; To generate statistical studies; To conduct market research and planning by sending user surveys; To notify user referrals of Slashdot Media services, information, or products when a user requests that Slashdot Media send such information to referrals; To improve services, information, and products; To help a user complete a transaction, or provide services or customer support to users and to recipients of Slashdot Media products; To communicate with the user and with recipients of Slashdot Media products; To update users and recipients of Slashdot Media products about services, information, and products; To personalize a Site for the user; To notify the user of any changes with a Site which may affect the user; To enforce terms of use on a Site; and To allow the user to purchase products, access services, or otherwise engage in activities the user selects. User names, identifications (“IDs”), and email addresses (as well as any additional information that a user may choose to post) may be publicly available on a Site when a user voluntarily and publicly discloses personally identifiable information, such as when a user posts personally identifiable information in conjunction with content subject to an Open Source license, or as part of a message posted to a public forum or a publicly-released software application. Users may not be able to change or remove public postings once posted. Such personally identifiable information may be used by visitors of these pages to send unsolicited messages. Slashdot Media is not responsible for any consequences which may occur from the use of personally identifiable information that a user chooses to submit to public pages. With respect to surveys, in the event that responses are publicly disclosed, users will be notified at the time they take the survey. Slashdot Media will disclose only aggregate information regarding its users, i.e., anonymous information that does not identify any specific individual. Circumstances under which Slashdot Media would publicly disclose such aggregate information include, but are not limited to, sharing survey results with the site population, providing data to Slashdot Media advertisers on user preferences and/or demographics, and publicizing overall usage data in press communications. Where surveys allow users to submit written comments, and where Slashdot Media advises users of the possibility of such disclosure at the time they take the survey, Slashdot Media reserves the right to disclose any information provided by users, provided that no personal information identifying a specific user is disclosed. Participation in surveys is at a user’s option; Slashdot Media does not conduct mandatory surveys. CHOICE/OPT OUT A user makes the decision whether to proceed with activities that request personally identifiable information, such as online contact us and order forms. If a user does not provide requested information, the user may not be able to complete certain transactions. Users who use the personally identifiable information of other users agree to use such information only for: Using services offered through a Site; Site transaction-related purposes and not for unsolicited commercial messages; or Other purposes that the other user expressly chooses. Users are not licensed to add other users to a Site, even users who entered into transactions with them, or to their mail lists without consent. Slashdot Media encourages users to evaluate privacy and security policies of any of the Sites’ transaction partners before entering into transactions or choosing to disclose personally identifiable information. Email Slashdot Media will not use the personally identifiable information provided to it online in ways unrelated to the purposes identified in the “How Slashdot Media uses the information collected” section above without first letting a user know and offering the user a choice. If a user no longer wishes to receive direct marketing materials, Slashdot Media will provide instructions in its marketing email messages on how to be removed from any lists. Slashdot Media will make commercially reasonable efforts to honor such requests. For information about how Slashdot Media may share personally identifiable information, please see the Onward Transfer section below. Users may have the opportunity to use a service to send electronic mail to another user or email list. In such cases, a user’s valid email address and real name will be included with such messages. In order to prevent abuse, users may not opt out of such a display, but may choose to refrain from using such service to transmit an email message. Slashdot Media sites may offer an email alias service that allows a user to create an email alias that forwards to the user’s personal email account. Slashdot Media does not publish a user’s personal email address, but does publicize email aliases which may allow an individual to identify or contact a user. A user who obtains an email alias may not opt out of such publication of the email alias. Please note, however, in certain cases, such as a “bounced-back” email message, it is possible that the user’s personal email address could be exposed to other parties to the communication. Profile or User ID Display A user’s personally identifiable information may be publicly available through a user’s profile or user ID display. Depending upon which of the Sites the user visits, the user may have the option to opt out of publicly displaying their real names by changing their display name under the Sites’ user preferences. Profile or user ID display may allow other users to see a user’s activities, including purchase and sales content, ratings, and comments. Photographs Users may have the opportunity to submit photographs to the Sites for product promotions, contests, and other purposes to be disclosed at the time of request. In these circumstances, the Sites are designed to allow the public to view, download, save, and otherwise access the photographs posted. By submitting photographs, users waive any privacy expectations users have with respect to the security of such photographs, and Slashdot Media’s use or exploitation of users’ likeness. All photographs submitted to Slashdot Media become the property of Slashdot Media and will not be returned. ONWARD TRANSFER With whom may Slashdot Media share information? "
	+ "Unless Slashdot Media has a user’s permission, as otherwise described in this Privacy Statement, or as required by law, such as to comply with a subpoena, Slashdot Media will only share the personally identifiable information a user provides online with other entities that are part of the Slashdot Media corporate family and/or outside service providers who may be used to ship products, process credit cards, provide technical support, handle order processing, or otherwise act on Slashdot Media’s behalf. These third party service providers are prohibited from using users’ information for any other purpose, including their own marketing. When Slashdot Media uses third parties to assist in processing a Site user’s personally identifiable information, Slashdot Media requires that these third parties establish safeguards to protect the confidentiality of the information that we provide them. For processing that involves information subject to Safe Harbor, we take steps to confirm that they subscribe to Safe Harbor, are subject to the EU Directive or another adequacy finding, or we enter into a written agreement requiring that they provide at least the same level of protection as required by the relevant Safe Harbor principles. Sites may share personally identifiable information with third parties for marketing purposes, but will provide users with choices about disclosures of personally identifiable information for marketing purposes. Please be advised that in certain instances, it may be necessary for Slashdot Media to disclose a user’s personally identifiable information without a user’s permission to government officials or otherwise as required by legal obligations. Slashdot Media may disclose such personally identifiable information when responding to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process, or to establish or exercise legal rights or defend against claims, including fraud or infringement investigations. Data collected online may be combined with information a user provides through other means of communication, such as postal mail or third parties to further carry out the purposes described above under the heading “How Slashdot Media uses the information collected.” When users choose to provide Slashdot Media with personally identifiable information, users consent to the transfer and storage of such information by Slashdot Media servers in the United States. In addition, Slashdot Media reserves the right to share aggregate information collected from users of the Sites, without prior notice, with entities that are part of the Slashdot Media corporate family and unrelated third parties. Aggregate information is used in a collective manner and no single person can be identified by such compiled information. Slashdot Media may share certain data from SourceForge.net, Freecode.com, Feedery.com, and Slashdot.org with researchers and research organizations for the sole purpose of supporting academic and scholarly research on free and/or open source software.  Slashdot Media may further choose to establish agreements, as in the case of University of Notre Dame, for these parties to act in a clearinghouse capacity and authorize them to share this data with other researchers studying free and/or open source software.  When data from these websites is transmitted to researchers, Slashdot Media makes commercially reasonable efforts to remove personally identifiable information from data fields designed to capture personally identifiable information (other than user names and information that users have made publicly available through one of the sites).  Slashdot Media, however, does not guarantee the complete removal of information that may identify a user, particularly in cases where the user has provided that information in comment fields or other fields not specifically designed for the collection of identifiers. Slashdot Media may make presentations, white papers and other content from other organizations available to the users of Slashdot Media sites.  To obtain access to this content you may be asked to provide personal information, such as your name and contact information.  This personal information may be shared with the organization that is making the content available and their use of the personal information will be subject to their own privacy policies. If you choose to make information available to other people through instant messages, status updates, group forum discussions or lists, electronic mail messages, bulletin boards, blog postings, or by joining groups or using other networking functions that we may offer on the Sites (either our own or through third party applications such as Facebook, Twitter or Linkedin), this information will be visible to these third parties. Please take care in deciding what information you choose to make available through these mechanisms, as we do not control the manner in which recipients or persons who may see the information may use, retain, or re-disclose the information that you choose to provide.  In addition, if you use third party social networking sites to interact with our sites, we may exchange information with those social networking sites.  Whether to use social networking sites to interact with our Sites, when that capability is offered, is your choice.  In addition, you may restrict the sharing of information from your social networking accounts to the extent permitted by your social networking site’s privacy settings. Service Orders To purchase services, users may be asked to be directed to a third party site, like PayPal, to pay for their purchases. If applicable, the third party site may collect payment information directly to facilitate a transaction. None of this information will be captured or stored by Slashdot Media. Links to third party web sites Links to third party web sites or widgets to enable sharing of information through social networks on the Sites are provided solely as a convenience to the user. When a user uses these links, the user leaves the Sites. Slashdot Media has not reviewed all of these third party sites, does not control, and is not responsible for, any of the third party sites, their content or privacy practices. Slashdot Media does not endorse or make any representations about the third party sites, or any information, services, or products found on the sites. If a user decides to access any of the linked sites, Slashdot Media encourages the user to read their privacy statements. The user accesses such sites at user’s own risk. Project Web SourceForge.net offers web hosting services that permit project teams to share information among developers and end users (“Project Web”). The project web services include a pool of web servers which serve project related web content and support common scripting language. Slashdot Media hosts these web servers, but does not review or control any of the web content, including personally identifiable information, which may be created by project teams; nor are we liable for any data breach related to a Project Web application. Web content created by Project Web teams may implement the collection of personally identifiable information; thus the Project Web teams are responsible for any required breach notification. Before linking to, accessing or otherwise using the project web services, a user should take those steps necessary, in such user’s discretion, to protect his or her privacy, including not using the Project Web services. Bankruptcy or Sale of business Slashdot Media reserves the right to share or transfer personally identifiable information and aggregate information to a third party should Slashdot Media ever file for bankruptcy or in the event of a sale, merger or acquisition of Slashdot Media, provided such third party agrees to adhere to the terms of this Privacy Statement. DATA INTEGRITY AND ACCESS Should a user find inaccuracies in such user’s information, or desire to close an account or view or remove the personally identifiable information Slashdot Media may have regarding the user, the user may contact Slashdot Media through the communication methods described below, or when technically feasible, directly on a Site. Slashdot Media will make commercially reasonable efforts to respond to requests for access, updating or removal within thirty (30) days of receiving requests. Slashdot Media may decline to process users’ access, updating or removal requests concerning their personally identifiable information if the requests require disproportionate technical effort, jeopardize the privacy of other users, are inconsistent with our legal obligations, or are impractical (for instance, requests concerning information residing on backup tapes). SECURITY To prevent unauthorized access or disclosure, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the appropriate use of information, Slashdot Media implements physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information Slashdot Media collects. Slashdot Media uses encryption when using the Internet to transfer or receive requested sensitive personally identifiable information. However, Slashdot Media does not guarantee that unauthorized third parties will never defeat measures taken to prevent improper use of personally identifiable information. Internal Slashdot Media access to users’ nonpublic personally identifiable information is restricted to Slashdot Media’s administrators and individuals on a need-to-know basis. These individuals are bound by confidentiality agreements. User passwords are keys to accounts. We use unique numbers, letters, and special characters for passwords and do not disclose passwords to other people in order to prevent loss of account control. Users are responsible for all actions taken in their accounts and are responsible to notify Slashdot Media of any password compromises, and change passwords periodically to maintain account protection. In addition to passwords, SourceForge.net users also obtain encryption keys for the release of files for download, development of web content, and other services. Users are responsible for all actions taken with encryption keys, and must promptly notify Slashdot Media of any security compromises involving such encryption keys. Data Retention We will retain your information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you services. If you wish to cancel your account or request that we no longer use your information to provide you services contact us at privacy@dice.com and we will deactivate your account and will retain and use your information only as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements. ENFORCEMENT In the event Slashdot Media becomes aware that the security of a Site has been compromised or user’s personally identifiable information has been disclosed to unrelated third parties as a result of external activity, including but not limited to security attacks or fraud, Slashdot Media reserves the right to take reasonable appropriate measures, including but not limited to, investigation and reporting, and notification to and cooperation with law enforcement authorities. In the event of a data breach, Slashdot Media will make reasonable efforts to notify affected individuals if Slashdot Media believes that there is a reasonable risk of harm to the user as a result of the breach or if notice is otherwise required by law.

To do that, we’ve set up procedures to ensure that your information is handled responsibly and in accordance with applicable data protection and privacy laws. We’re grateful for your trust, and we’ll act that way. This will teach you what info we collect and how we use it. If you wanted to learn to play the keytar, you’re in the wrong place.	 This privacy policy describes what information we collect when you visit the network, how we use that information, and what choices we offer you to access, update, and control it. This version of the policy is effective as of June 28, 2012. Safe Harbor Overview We follow the strict Safe Harbor Framework that complies with the EU and Swiss privacy requirements.	 We have chosen to comply with the principles of the Safe Harbor Framework developed by the U.S. Department of Commerce in consultation with the European Commission and the Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner of Switzerland, except where limited by any legal, regulatory, ethical or public interest considerations. More information about the principles that make up the Framework, as well as other frequently asked questions relating to Safe Harbor can be found at: http://www.export.gov/safeharbor. Types of Information “Personal” information can potentially identify who you are. “Personal information” is any information that we could use to identify an individual. It does not include personal information that is encoded or anonymized, or publicly available information that has not been combined with non-public information. “Sensitive” information can identify specific private attributes, such as ethnicity, health info, criminal history, or trade affiliations. “Sensitive personal information,” is information that meets the “personal information” criteria and also a) reveals race, ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, trade union membership, or b) concerns health or sex life, information about social security benefits, or information on criminal or administrative proceedings other than in the context of pending legal proceedings. How We Collect Information We collect information two ways: Information we get from your use of the network, and information you provide to us directly. Your web browser tells us stuff like your approximate location and how you use the site. It also bakes us yummy cookies.	Information we get from your use of the network is primarily non-personally- identifying information of the sort that web browsers, servers, and services like Google Analytics* typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the time of each visit. Other non-identifying information that we might have access to includes how you use the service (e.g., search queries), your approximate location, cookies, etc. We try to use this non-personal info to help make better Q&A sites, and to destroy spam. We eat the cookies.	 We collect this non-personally identifying information in order to better understand how visitors use the service and where possible, to improve their experience. For instance, we may monitor the most common content on the network to help identify spam. In some cases, we may publicly display information that is not personally identifying in the aggregate, (e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of the network,) or may provide it to third parties. Your browser also gives us your IP address, which could identify you, but we don’t use it to do that. For real.	 When you use the network, we also collect potentially personally identifying information in the form of Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. But we don’t use that information to identify you, and we handle and disclose these addresses in the same way we handle other potentially personally identifying information as described below. If you register an account, you may need to give us your email and other personal info, but we’re not the boss of you and can’t make you. Information you provide to us directly. Certain visitors to the network choose to interact with it in ways that may require them to provide us with personally identifying information. The amount and type of information that is provided depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up for stackoverflow.com to provide a username and email address. Employers who engage in financial transactions with careers.stackoverflow.com are asked to provide additional information, such as the personal and financial information required to process those transactions. We use a payment gateway to protect financial information we collect online, and we only collect as much information as is necessary or appropriate given the type of interaction. We do not disclose personally identifying information other than as described below. And you can always refuse to supply personally identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent you from engaging in certain activities. The non-identifying content of a service request may be made public. You want to help, don’t you?	 If you send us a request, such as emailing us for support, we reserve the right to publish it (absent any personally identifying information) in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or help other users. If you don’t like cookies or have other dietary restrictions, please tell your browser.	 A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor’s computer, and that the visitor’s browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. We use cookies to help us track visitors’ use of the network and their preferences. If you do not wish to have cookies placed on your computer, you should set your browser to refuse cookies, but should be aware that certain features of the network may not function properly without them. Our servers live in the United States. So, if you send us your info, that’s where it’s going.	 If you are outside the United States, you should know that any personally identifiable information you enter into the network will be transferred out of your country and into the United States, and possibly to other countries. By using the network, you consent to such transfer, and are representing that you have the right to transfer such information outside your country. If you’re under 13, we want to mind our own business, not yours.	 We do not knowingly collect any personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13. If you believe that a child has provided us with personally identifiable information without the consent of his or her parent or guardian, please contact us at team@stackexchange.com. If we become aware that a child under age 13 has provided us with personally identifiable information, we’ll delete it. Information You Choose to Display Publicly on the Network If you decide to post personal information in the public parts of our sites, it’s… um, public.	 Some users may elect to publicly post personally identifying or sensitive information about themselves in their normal use of the network. This could occur through use of the optional profile fields, in question or answer posts, or when an individual posts a job history on the Careers site. Information like that, which is voluntarily posted in publicly visible parts of the network, is considered to be public, even if it would otherwise be considered to be personally identifying or sensitive. As such, it is not subject to the protocols listed below, because we don’t control it; you do. Additionally, voluntarily publicizing such information means that you lose any privacy rights you might normally have with regards to that information. It also increases your chances of receiving unwanted communications, like spam. Information You Give to Other People We’re not responsible for any information you give other websites we link to. Sort of like how your TV maker isn’t responsible if you buy a lousy product, even if you saw it in an awesome commercial.	 This Policy only applies to information collected by Stack Exchange. It does not apply to the practices of companies that we don’t own or control, or employees that we don’t manage. The network contains links to third party websites, and any information you provide to those sites will be covered by any privacy policies they may have. Please be sure to read the privacy policies of any third-party sites you visit. It is those sites’ responsibility to protect any information you give them, so we can’t be held liable for their wrongful use of your personally identifying information. How We Use Information We Collect We will tell you what we’re collecting, what we’re doing with it, and when we might share it with others. (Almost never, unless you ask us to.)	Notice – Notice is what this privacy policy that you’re reading is all about. You are reading it, right? It’s important! When we collect your personal information, we’ll tell you how we’re using it, any types of third parties to which we might disclose it, (other than moderators or “agents,” such as vendors or contractors, who are only processing such information for us or at our direction), and the choices we offer you to limit the use of your information. We’ll tell you all this stuff as soon as you register. Notice will be provided in clear and conspicuous language when you are first asked to provide us with personal information, or as soon as practicable thereafter, and we’ll notify you before we use the information for something other than the purpose for which it was originally collected. If anything in this policy seems unclear, please don’t hesitate to contact us at team@stackexchange.com, so we can address your question and possibly clarify this document. If we change this policy, we’ll update this document to keep you in the loop.	 Although most changes are likely to be minor, we may occasionally need to change this policy. If we do update it, we’ll notify you either by posting the new policy on the network or by emailing you the changes or a link to the modified document. (See the “Choice” section below for information about how we’ll notify you if we change our policy regarding sensitive information.) In any case, the way we use information you provide will be covered by the privacy policy that was in effect at the time it was collected. We mostly use your information to customize and improve your (and others’) experience.	Here are some of the ways we may use personal information you provide us: To allow you to register for our web sites, online communities and other services, and to administer and process those registrations To communicate with you about our products, services and related issues To evaluate the quality of our products and services, and to enhance your experience on our web sites To help employers find or contact users who post profiles on the Careers site To maintain and administer our web sites and comply with our legal or internal obligations and policies To transfer information to others as described in this policy or to satisfy our legal, regulatory, compliance, or auditing requirements Choice – Choice is all about making sure you have the ability to control how we share your personal information with others. We almost never share any of your personal information with non-agent third parties, with one exception, where you basically are asking us to do so: If you post a profile on Careers, employers can see your name, and if you apply for a job, we give them your contact info. (Because they can’t hire you if they can’t contact you.)	 Users who post profiles on our Careers site are generally doing so for the express purpose of getting connected with potential employers. So, if you post a profile on our Careers site, and choose to make your profile visible to employers, your name (which is required) and most of the other (optional) information in your profile will be visible to employers searching for candidates. That said, your contact information (email, phone, and address) will not be provided to employers in their candidate searches. We will only allow employers to have access to your contact information in two cases, both of which are under your control: If you apply directly for a specific job, you will be asked to provide your name and email address (and other optional information) to the employer If an employer finds you through a search and wants to contact you, we will ask if you are interested in hearing from them, and if you are, we will then provide them with your contact information. Outside of when you apply for job listings, we don’t share your personal info with anyone. That could theoretically change in a merger, etc. but the buyer would still be bound by these rules. Other than on Careers, we won’t share your personal information with non-agent third parties unless we are required to do so by law, or if we believe in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect our property, rights or those of third parties or the public at large. It is possible that we may, on occasion, buy or sell assets from or to other companies. If that should occur, user information is typically one of the assets that get transferred. Similarly, if Stack Exchange or most of its assets were acquired, or in the unlikely event that we go out of business or enter bankruptcy, user information could be transferred or acquired. You should be aware that such events can occur, and that if it does, the buyer may continue to use your personal and non-personal information, but only as set forth in this policy. Other than in these rare circumstances, Stack Exchange will not rent or sell potentially personally identifying information to anyone. In the unlikely event that we should need to collect and transfer your sensitive information, we’ll ask first.	 It’s hard to imagine that we would ever consider collecting, let alone sharing, sensitive information with a non-agent third party, but if such a day should come, we will first give you the opportunity to explicitly consent (opt-in) to such disclosure or to any use of the information for a purpose other than the one for which it was originally collected or previously authorized. If you give us your email, we may email you. But probably not very often. We’re busy, too.	 If you are a registered user of the network and have supplied your email address, we may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what’s going on with the network. We generally use the network to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of communication to a minimum. If we do send you information that you did not expressly request, we will provide you with a way to request that you don’t get any similar notices (opt-out). Anyone that has access to your info will be required to treat it like we do.	Onward Transfer – Prior to providing agents with any personal information, we will obtain assurances that they will safeguard it in accordance with this policy. Examples of assurances that may be provided include: A commitment that they will handle in the information in accordance with this policy, or will provide the same level of protection, as required by the Safe Harbor Principles, subject to EU Directive 95/46/EC (“the EU Data Protection Directive”); Safe Harbor certification by the agent, or being subject to another European Commission adequacy finding. In the unlikely event that we should discover that an agent is using personal information in way that conflicts with this policy, we will take all reasonable steps to stop them immediately. We promise to work hard to keep your info safe, and to restrict who can access it.	Security – All records containing personal or financial information are considered to be our property and are afforded confidential treatment at all times. We work hard to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of personal or financial information. All such electronic information is stored on restricted database servers, and is generally kept until such time as you may ask us to edit or delete it, as described below. We only disclose such information to our employees, agents or affiliates that a) need to know that information in order to process it for us or to provide other services, and b) have agreed not to disclose it to others. We want to keep your data accurate and up to date, so…	Data Integrity – In addition to assuring you that we will protect your personal information, we also want to make sure that it is reliable, accurate, and up-to-date. In order to do that, we provide: …we’ll provide it to you to review. Within reason.	Access – Upon request, we will provide you with reasonable access to the personal information we collect about you. You will have the opportunity to correct, update, modify or delete this information by sending an e-mail to team@stackexchange.com. Please note that some information may remain in our records even after you request deletion of your information as permitted by the Safe Harbor Principles. Additionally, there may be limits to the amount of information we can practically provide. For example, we may limit an individual’s access to personal information where the burden or expense of providing access would be disproportionate to the risks to the individual’s privacy or where doing so would violate others’ rights. Enforcement – We will conduct internal audits of our compliance with this privacy policy, including an annual self-assessment. Our employees take your privacy as seriously as we do, and we will take all reasonable measures against any employee found to be in violation of this policy. If you have any concerns about your privacy, we genuinely want to know about it.	 If you have any concerns or complaints about how you think we’ve handled your personal information, please contact team@stackexchange.com or our Data Protection Officer at the address below. We will work hard to investigate and resolve any complaints you might have. In the really, really, super-unlikely event that we can’t help, you can contact eTrust.	 We hope it won’t ever come to this, but if you’ve already contacted us and feel that your complaint cannot be resolved between the two of us, we have agreed to participate in the dispute resolution procedures established in the "

The information The New York Times gathers falls into two categories: 1) Personal information, which includes personal information you supply when you subscribe, order, complete a survey, register for one of our sites, enter a contest or provide your e-mail address and 2) Non-personal information collected through technology, which includes tracking information collected as you use the NYT Services.

OTHER INFORMATION Compliance With Legal Process We may disclose personal information if we are required to do so by law or we have a good faith belief that such action is necessary to (1) comply with the law or with legal process; (2) protect and defend our rights and property; (3) protect against misuse or unauthorized use of the NYT Services; or (4) protect the personal safety or property of our users or the public (among other things, this means that if you provide false information or attempt to pose as someone else, information about you may be disclosed as part of any investigation into your actions). Children's Guidelines COPPA Compliance. Except for The Learning Network (see below), The New York Times does not knowingly collect or store any personal information about children under the age of 13. The Learning Network. The Learning Network is a free service for parents, teachers and students, and does not require registration. The Student Connections section is specifically directed at students, grades 6 to 12. Within this section, the Ask a Reporter page and the Student Letters page allow students to either send a question to a Times reporter or submit a letter to the editor, providing their first name, grade, state/country and, optionally, their e-mail address. The information requested on these pages is used solely for participation in these activities, and is not shared or sold to third parties. If an e-mail address is provided, it will only be used for a one-time response back to the child. After responding to the child, the e-mail address is deleted. Access to the above services is not conditioned on more information than is reasonably necessary to provide the services. Because we're concerned about a parent's right to consent to the collection and use of their child's personal information, when a question or letter is published, only the student's first name, grade and state/country appear on the site. To request removal of this information (non-personally identifiable) or to review or remove the optional e-mail address (personal information collected), please use this form to contact the Learning Network. These children's guidelines have been developed with the recognition that Internet technology evolves rapidly and that underlying business models are still not established. Accordingly, guidelines are subject to change. In the unlikely event of such changes they will be posted on this page. If the changes represent a material departure from our current practice with respect to the use of children's personal information, the changes will be posted on this page thirty days prior to taking effect and will not affect children's personal information previously collected. For any questions concerning The Learning Network, please contact Katherine Schulten, NYTimes.com, 620 Eighth Avenue, 9th floor, New York, NY 10018. Telephone: (212) 556-8391. Your California Privacy Rights Under the California “Shine The Light” law, California residents may opt-out of the NYT’s disclosure of personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes. As detailed above, you may choose to opt-out of the sharing of your personal information with third parties for marketing purposes at any time by submitting a request in writing to Customer Care, P.O. Box 8041, Davenport, IA 52808-8041 or by e-mailing us at opt-out@nytimes.com. It is important to note that this opt-out does not prohibit disclosures made for non-marketing purposes. Changes to This Policy This Privacy Policy may be amended from time to time. Any such changes will be posted on this page. If we make a significant or material change in the way we use your personal information, the change will be posted on this page thirty (30) days prior to taking effect and registered users will be notified via e-mail.");

Registration information is used to enable visitors to take advantage of site offerings; respond to visitor’s requests for products, services, and information; manage games; serve appropriate material; customize the content you see when you visit the Nickelodeon Sites; and offer visitors special offers and promotions from Nickelodeon Sites and the “Viacom family of companies” (which comprises Viacom International Inc. and its subsidiaries and affiliates, including but not limited to NeoPets, Inc. and Atom Entertainment, Inc.), as well as on behalf of selected third parties offering products, programs or services, that we believe may be of interest to you. B. Social Platform Registrations and Social Media Plugins: Some of the Nickelodeon Sites permit or require users who are at least 13 years old to register or log into their account via a social networking platform such as Login with Facebook or Flux, or permit you to use social media plugins such as the Facebook “Like” or Google “+1” buttons. When you use these social networking platforms and plugins, your username and password for the services and other information available about you or collected from you on these services may be shared with us. When you use social networking platforms and plugins, you share your information with them and their privacy policy applies to their collection, use, and disclosure of such information. In addition, they may be able to collect information about you, including your activity on the Nickelodeon Sites, and they may notify your connections on the social networking platform about your use of the Nickelodeon Sites. Such services may also employ unique identifiers which allow your activity to be monitored across multiple websites for purposes of delivering more targeted advertising to you. For more information about Login with Facebook, please go here. For more information on Flux, please go here. Please note that their privacy policies may be different from our own and we encourage you to read them. C. Computer Information Collected by Us:  When visitors come to a Site, we may automatically collect certain information from their computers or mobile devices, such as the type of computer operating system (e.g., Windows XP or Mac OS), the visitor's IP address, the web browser (e.g., Internet Explorer, Safari, Chrome and Firefox), UDID (for mobile devices), information about the websites visited before and after visiting the Site, the web pages and advertisements viewed and links clicked on within the Nickelodeon Sites, interactions with e-mail messages sent by a Site or the Viacom family of companies (e.g., links clicked on and whether the messages were opened or forwarded), information collected through the use of unique identifiers such as cookies (see below), information regarding the Internet service provider, and other standard server log information (Computer Information). We may use cookies, web beacons, tokens or similar technologies (collectively referred to as “Tracking Technologies”) on the Nickelodeon Sites. Cookies (which may be html files, Flash files or other technology) are text files that help store user preferences and activity. “Web beacons” (also known as image tags, gif or web bugs) are small pieces of code used to collect advertising data, such as counting page views, promotion views or advertising responses.  “Tokens” are unique persistent identifiers that are generated and sent from a server, such as Adobeâ??s Pass service, to a userâ??s device to identify an interaction session, such as the authentication for a userâ??s cable provider service, and which are usually stored as an HTTP cookie. The Site and/or third parties may use Tracking Technologies to collect Computer Information automatically as you browse the Site and the web. We may use Tracking Technologies to help tailor our content, allow users to move between certain Nickelodeon Sites without logging into each Site, enable the internal functioning of the Nickelodeon Sites, understand Site and internet usage, improve or customize the content, offerings or advertisements on this Site, personalize your experience on the Site (for example, to recognize you by name when you return to the Site), understand your interactions with email messages originating from the Nickelodeon Sites or the Viacom family of companies (such as the links clicked on and whether the messages were opened or forwarded), save your password, save your online game or video player settings, enable you to use shopping carts, help us offer you products, programs or services that may be of interest to you, deliver relevant advertising, maintain and administer the Nickelodeon Sites.  These Tracking Technologies collect “click stream” data and additional other information regarding your visits to the Nickelodeon Sites (such as your visits to specific webpages, use of features, purchasing history or preferences), may collect such other information across multiple sessions on the Nickelodeon Sites and other websites offered by the Viacom family of companies and may also collect your IP address or some other identifier unique to the device you use to access the site (“Identifier”). An Identifier may be automatically assigned to any device you use to access the Nickelodeon Sites. When a cable television service subscriber authenticates his cable television service to view full episodes of Nickelodeon programing in the Nick mobile app, a third party token is stored on the userâ??s mobile device so that the subscriber can view Nickelodeon television episodes in the future without having to re-authenticate his cable service subscription. By visiting a Site, whether as a registered user or otherwise, you acknowledge, understand and hereby agree that you are giving us your consent to track your activities and your use of a Site through these Tracking Technologies and Identifiers and that we may use Tracking Technologies in the emails we send to you. The Nickelodeon Sites adhere to the Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising. Click here for more information about the Nickelodeon Sites and online behavioral advertising.

This is done through your browser on the device you use to access the Nickelodeon Sites. Additional information on warnings and removal of warnings may be available through your browser’s support feature. Please note that deleting, rejecting, disabling or turning off Tracking Technologies through the above options will not remove Flash cookies. For more information about Flash cookies and how to remove them from your computer, please visit here Please be aware that certain areas and features of Nickelodeon Sites can only be accessed in conjunction with Tracking Technologies, and that disabling Tracking Technologies might prevent you from accessing such content. D. Computer Information Collected By Others: The Nickelodeon Group uses the services of third parties who may collect, use or disclose cookie information, IP addresses or other identifiers from devices and/or browsers of users who visit Nickelodeon Sites that are directed to children. For a list of these third parties on Nickelodeon Sites that are directed to children or where Nickelodeon has actual knowledge that a user is under 13, please go here. Nickelodeon Sites use a variety of third-party advertising networks, data exchanges, traffic measurement service providers, marketing analytics service providers, and other third-party service providers (collectively, “Third Party Advertising Service Providers”) to, for example, serve advertisements on the Nickelodeon Sites, facilitate targeting of advertisements, and measure and analyze advertising effectiveness and/or traffic on the Nickelodeon Sites (“Targeting Services”). These Targeting Services enable us to display advertisements based on your visits to the Nickelodeon Sites and other websites you have visited and may include delivering advertisements or other content for products and services that may interest you. Targeting Services also help prevent you from seeing repeated advertisements and enable us to research the usefulness of certain advertisements. Nickelodeon does not behaviorally target advertising to children under 13 on sites that are directed to children or where Nickelodeon has actual knowledge that a user is under 13. These Third Party Advertising Service Providers do not have access to Tracking Technologies set by the Nickelodeon Sites except to the extent necessary to provide services to the Nickelodeon Sites. The Third Party Advertising Service Providers, as well as advertisers, may themselves set and access their own Tracking Technologies on your device if you choose to have Tracking Technologies enabled in your browser (or, for Flash cookies, if you have not removed them) and/or they may otherwise have "
	+ "access to Other Information about you. In addition, Third Party Advertising Service Providers may collect aggregate log data separately and independently from what the Nickelodeon Sites collect. You should be aware that different rules might apply to the collection, use or disclosure of your information by third parties in connection with their advertisements, promotions and other websites you encounter on the Internet. The use of such technology by these third parties is within their control and not the Nickelodeon Sites. Even if we have a relationship with the third party, we do not control those sites or their policies and practices regarding your information and those sites may use the information they collect from you consistent with their own privacy policies, which we encourage you to review. We encourage you to research and direct any of your questions in this regard to these third parties. With respect to the Tracking Technologies set by Third Party Advertising Service Providers and advertisers (and outside the control of the Nickelodeon Sites), you have a number of options: You can opt-out of the use of information for these advertising purposes by two such Third Party Advertising Service Providers, Adobe and DoubleClick by using those Providers’ opt-out tools.  You can access Adobe’s tool at http://www.donottarget.com/ and DoubleClick’s at http://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/technologies/ads/.  We also may from time to time permit other Third Party Advertising Service Providers and Advertisers to collect Information on the Nickelodeon Sites.  Some of these Providers and Advertisers may participate in the Network Advertising Initiative’s Opt-Out Tool and/or the Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavioral Advertising Please click on the links to these tools to learn more about your choices.  Please note the following with respect to opting out of Tracking Technologies set by Third Party Advertising Service Providers and advertisers: The opt-out tools discussed above are “cookie based.” This means that the tools rely on cookies to remember your choices with respect to the use of your information by the parties that offer you those choices. If you opt-out but then use the controls in your browser to delete all Tracking Technologies, you may have to opt-out again, a second time, in order to re-establish your opt-out preferences. Opt-outs are browser-specific. This means, for example, that if you opt out while using Internet Explorer 9, this choice will not affect the collection of information collected by Tracking Technologies when you use Mozilla Firefox on the same device. It also means that opting out on one device will not affect the collection of information by Tracking Technologies on other devices you may use to access the Nickelodeon Sites. You also can prevent the use of certain Tracking Technologies (other than Flash cookies) on a particular device by using the controls in your Web browser. To do so, you must complete both of the following steps: Delete existing Tracking Technologies through the “Internet Options” sub-option of the “Tools” menu option of your browser or otherwise as directed by your browser’s support feature; and Disable future Tracking Technologies by using the same browser controls. Additional information on disabling most Tracking Technologies may be available through your browser’s support feature. (See the “help” section of your browser for more information.) You may be able to set the device you use to access the Nickelodeon Sites to warn you each time a cookie or most other Tracking Technologies is being set (other than Flash cookies), or you can choose to turn off such warnings. This is done through your browser on the device you use to access the Nickelodeon Sites. Additional information on warnings and removal of warnings may be available through your browser’s support feature. Opting-out of, deleting, rejecting, disabling or turning off Third Party Advertising Service Providers’ Tracking Technologies does not mean that you will no longer receive online ads.

To enter these contests and sweepstakes, you may be required to provide your first name and email address and/or additional information required for the management of the contest or sweepstakes.  On sites that either are directed to children under 13 or where we have actual knowledge that a user is a child under 13, we may collect the child’s e-mail address to enter the child in the contest or sweepstakes, store such child’s email address for the duration of the sweepstakes, and use it for notification if he or she is the winner. For certain contests or sweepstakes on such sites, we may ask for the email address of the child's parent or guardian to inform the parent or guardian of his or her child's entry and give the parent or guardian the option to have the child's entry deleted. F.  Electronic Postcards and Messages: Some Nickelodeon Sites provide visitors the opportunity to send electronic postcards and “wish lists” of items they want to family or friends, which means we will send, on the visitor’s behalf, email messages to family and/or friends. To do so, visitors must provide the email address of the recipient of such electronic postcards or email messages. Email addresses provided to us for this purpose are used solely to send the requested postcard or email message and are deleted from our system once the postcard or message is sent.  In some cases, we may offer visitors an incentive (e.g., points to be used in an online game) for referring information about products to the visitor's family or friends.  In such cases, we will comply with all applicable legal requirements. Please note that this feature may not be available to visitors in certain regions. G. Electronic Newsletters: Visitors can provide their email addresses to receive email newsletters and promotions from the Nickelodeon Group, the Viacom family of companies, and our business partners.  Visitors may change their preferences regarding emails at any time through the unsubscribe link in the newsletters or, for certain Nickelodeon Sites, by logging into and changing the preferences for their account.  When visitors to Nickelodeon Sites that either are directed to children under 13 or have actual knowledge that a user is a child under 13 years old ask to receive our email newsletter(s), they will be asked to provide their first name, email address and the email address of their parent/guardian. We will send the child's parent/guardian a notification email informing them of the child's request to receive by email the newsletter on an ongoing basis and give the parent/guardian the option to have his or her child's information removed from our newsletter database. The link to remove the child’s information will expire approximately 48 hours from the time it is sent, but at any time after receiving this notification email, the child's parent/guardian may request that we stop sending the child the newsletter(s) by following the unsubscribe instructions found at the end of any of the newsletter emails.  Parents/guardians may at any time review any personally identifiable information collected online about their child. See section V (B) below. When a child provides a parent's/guardian's email address when signing up for newsletter(s), that email address is used to send the notification email message and is subsequently deleted from our system. H. Interactive Features and Services: Some of the Nickelodeon Sites offer interactive features and services, such as message boards, chat rooms, electronic mail services, comment boxes, messaging services, and member profile pages. For certain countries, on Nickelodeon Sites that either are directed to children under 13 or have actual knowledge that a user is a child under 13 years old, we either will obtain the consent of the child’s parent before allowing the child to use these interactive features and services or will use reasonable technical measures to delete all or virtually all personal information from a child’s postings before they are made public and also delete such information from our records. We use the information collected through interactive features and services to enable you to participate in such features and services. I.

We want you to know that we apply our long-standing commitment to safeguarding privacy to our online and Internet activities. MCI participates in the industry-leading BBBOnline(r) Privacy Program. The BBBOnline(r) Privacy Seal verifies that MCI stands behind its privacy policy. The BBBOnline(r) Privacy Seal is the trust mark of the online arm of the Council of Better Business Bureaus and is dedicated to promoting trust and confidence on the Internet. More information about the privacy seal program is available at http://www.bbbonline.org/ Click on the links that follow or scroll down for additional information on these topics: A. Personally Identifiable Information B. How We Use Information C. How We Collect Information D. Security E. Your Access to Information In addition to this general online privacy policy, you may receive notice of other terms that apply to particular promotions or services. Personally Identifiable Information MCI does not share, disclose or sell any personally-identifiable information (such as your name, address, telephone number or e-mail address) collected online on MCI sites with other unaffiliated companies or organizations for non-MCI marketing purposes. In the future, should MCI decide to share such data with third parties for marketing, it will provide notification and the opportunity for its users to indicate whether they would prefer that the Company not provide such information about them to third parties. Because this information is a critical part of our business, it would be treated like our other assets in the context of a merger, sale or other corporate reorganization or legal proceeding. MCI also does not market to, or knowingly collect personal information from, children under the age of 13 on Company sites. Click here to return to top How We Use Information MCI uses the personally-identifiable information we collect online principally to provide you with the service(s) you have ordered and to let you know about other offerings which may be of interest to you. Postal and e-mail address information, for example, enables communication about services offered and ordered, as well as the proper provisioning and billing of those services. Because MCI makes many special benefits available to you through relationships with other businesses (such as airline miles), MCI shares personally-identifiable online customer information with those businesses so that you receive the benefits to which you are entitled. We also sometimes use this information to extend special offers to you jointly with our partners. Like most large businesses today, MCI uses vendors to carry out certain functions in marketing and delivering services to you (such as processing data files and sending you new order fulfillment information), and so shares online data with those vendors to the extent necessary for them to perform their work. Of course, such partners and vendors must use that personally-identifiable information only for the purpose(s) for which it was shared and protect it from any further use. MCI also shares such information with other industry and credit-related organizations to improve operations and to protect against fraud, security and credit risks. We also provide personally-identifiable online information in response to subpoenas and other legal demands, and where we believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against individuals who may be endangering public safety or interfering with MCI property or services, or with our customers' or others' use of them. Click here to return to top How We Collect Information MCI collects information online by asking you for it, for example, when you order a service, apply for a job, or respond to a survey, sweepstakes or other promotion. A customer's name, address (postal and e-mail) and telephone number are the most important pieces of information, but we might request other information, based on, for example, the service(s) being ordered or promoted. MCI may also use cookies and similar technology to obtain information about your visits to our sites or your responses to e-mail from us - both individually and in aggregated data that does not identify you. These reporting tools tell us the parts of our web sites or e-mails in which you showed an interest or took some action, and help us improve the quality and usefulness of our sites. At MCI, we primarily use cookies to determine what services or promotions you are interested in. While cookies help us improve your experience while visiting our sites and customize our communications to the services you may desire, you have the option to block them through your Internet browser or other commercially available software. However, doing so may make some of our sites' features unavailable to you. Another way we collect information online is through our affinity program partners who may provide us with information they already obtained from you online. For example when you are on a partner's site and click on a MCI banner that takes you to a MCI site, information that the partner has received from you already may be passed to MCI. Click here to return to top Security We use encryption, firewalls and other technology and security procedures to help protect the accuracy and security of your personal information and prevent unauthorized access or improper use. For example, you will note that while using some features of the MCI web sites and online services, you will need to submit a password or some other type of authenticating information. Click here to return to top Your Access to Information You may review or update the available personally identifiable information that we received from you online by accessing your account online, by contacting Consumer Service through the toll free number or e-mail address on your invoice, or through the Company contact information below. Please note that in order to better protect you and safeguard your information, we take steps to verify your identity before granting access or making corrections to your information. MCI may use e-mail addresses you provide us online on MCI sites to send you e-mail related to MCI products and services or if you have affirmatively indicated a desire to receive additional information. If at any time, you would prefer not to receive further e-mail communications at that e-mail address, please contact Customer Service through the toll free number or e-mail address on your invoice.

Companies Offering Promotions, Products, or Services At times we will provide you with the opportunity to opt-in to receive promotions, products or services from third party sponsors. With your permission, The Weather Channel will periodically send to you, via e-mail, offers and promotions from our third party sponsors which we select based upon your interests or user profile. In this case we do not share your information with the third party sponsors-we do the mailing for them.

D. Other Web Sites, Other Services, and Links Like many Web sites on the Internet and other Internet-based services, many of our Services link to pages located on Web sites or services maintained by various other entities. In some cases you may link to pages of other Web sites that are framed with elements of our Services such as in the header or footer. In that case the URL will identify the site you are visiting. In other cases, such as advertisements, you will be connecting to another site or service when you click on or otherwise activate those opportunities, including click-to-call, click-to-text, and click-to-email opportunities. These other sites and services are not bound by our privacy policy, and we are not responsible for their information collection practices. The privacy policies of other organizations may differ from ours, for example, with respect to the level of security, use of cookies, and collection, use and disclosure of personally identifiable information.

You will remain logged in to those other sites and services until you log off those sites and services. By proceeding with these interfaces, you are allowing our Services to access your information on those other sites and services, and you are agreeing to those other sites' and services' Terms of Use. Once you log into those other sites and services, the content you post on those other sites and services may also post to our Services. Your use of those other sites and services is subject to the privacy policies of those sites and services, and not this Privacy Policy. Some of our Services use third party operating systems, platforms, communication services, devices, and software elements (such as mobile device operating systems, wireless services, mobile phone and tablet devices), and some of our Services are provided by third party distributors, device makers, device operators, platform operators, and communication services. The Weather Channel does not control these third party entities, products and services, and they may collect, use, process, transmit and disclose your information.

	sessionStorage.setItem("TRAIND", "Privacy policy TripAdvisor is an online service that provides recommendations for hotels, resorts, inns, vacations, travel packages, travel guides and lots more. Our Web site is part of the TripAdvisor® Media Network, which is owned and operated by TripAdvisor LLC. More details about TripAdvisor LLC can be found below under “How you can contact us.” We understand that providing information online involves a great deal of trust on your part. We take this trust very seriously, and make it a high priority to ensure the security and confidentiality of the personal information you provide to us. Before submitting your personal information to our Web site, please read this Policy carefully to learn about our privacy practices. By visiting TripAdvisor’s Web site, www.tripadvisor.com, you are accepting the practices described herein. What information we collect from you How we use your information With whom we share your information How you can access your information Your choices with respect to the collection and use of your information How we protect your information Children's privacy External links Visiting our Web site from outside the United States Your California privacy rights Changes to this Privacy Policy How you can contact us What information we collect from you In General. We receive and store any information you enter on our Web site or give us in any other way. This includes information that can identify you (personal information), including your first and last name, telephone number, postal and e-mail addresses, user name and password. We may also request information about your travel plans, style, and preferences, including meal requests, seat selection, frequent flyer/hotel/car rental program information, and flight class, luggage, and ticketing options. You can choose not to provide information to us, but in general some information about you is required in order for you to enjoy the benefits of being a registered member. For example, only registered members are able to post travel reviews, participate in discussion forums, e-mail TripAdvisor content to themselves and others, access members-only newsletters and travel planning content, and enter surveys, contests, or sweepstakes. In addition, some information is also required in order for you to ask us a question or initiate other transactions on our site. Information About Others. You will have the opportunity to provide contact information for other people through our Web site. You should obtain the consent of other individuals prior to providing TripAdvisor with their personal information. Information from Other Sources. We also may periodically obtain both personal and non-personal information about you from affiliated entities, business partners and other independent third-party sources and add it to other information about you. For example, if you visit TripAdvisor by “clicking-through” from a site operated by one of our business partners, and you have registered with that partner, then information about you that you have provided to that partner may be shared with us,such as contact information and demographic information. As another example, if you access third party services, such as social media services, through our Web site or before coming to our Website, we may collect information such as your user name, password, and other information made available to us through those services in order to improve and personalize your use of our Web site. We have partnered with Facebook to provide Instant Personalization on TripAdvisor for members of Facebook. If you have Instant Personalization set to enabled in your Facebook privacy settings and you are logged into Facebook, then TripAdvisor will be personalized for you when you visit the Web site, even if you are a first-time user of TripAdvisor’s Web site. For example, we will show you reviews that your Facebook friends have posted on TripAdvisor and places they have visited. In order to provide you with this personalized experience, Facebook provides us with information that you have chosen to make available pursuant to your Facebook privacy settings. That information may include your name, profile picture, gender, friend lists and any other information you have chosen to make available. When you first visit TripAdvisor, you will see an option to turn off Instant Personalization in just one click. If you decide to turn it off at a later date, you can do so by first logging into Facebook and clicking on the disable link on this page, or by scrolling over the “Learn More” link on the top of the page on TripAdvisor and clicking on “How to turn off personalization”. You can also turn off Instant Personalization by editing your privacy settings on Facebook. Please note that, if you have Facebook friends who are using TripAdvisor, they may also have shared information about you with us through Facebook. If you wish to prevent that sharing, you can do so by editing your Facebook privacy settings. Learn more about Instant Personalization on Facebook or read TripAdvisor’s Instant Personalization FAQ’s. Automatic Information. We automatically collect some information about your computer when you visit TripAdvisor. For example, we will collect session data, including your IP address, Web browser software, and referring Web site. We also may collect information about your online activity, such as content viewed and pages visited. One of our goals in collecting this automatic information is to help us understand the interests of our users and customize your user experience. Cookies and Other Web Technologies. Cookies are small data text files and can be stored on your computer’s hard drive (if your Web browser permits). TripAdvisor.com and its affiliated websites use cookies for the following general purposes: To help us recognize your browser as a previous visitor and save and remember any preferences that may have been set while your browser was visiting our site. For example, if you register on our site, we may use cookies to remember your registration information, so you do not need to log into our site each time you visit. We also may record your password in a cookie, if you checked the box entitled Save this password for automatic sign-in. Please note that member IDs, passwords, and any other account-related data included in such cookies are encrypted for security purposes. To help us customize the content, website experience,and advertisements provided to you on our websites and on other websites across the Internet. For example, when you access a web page, a cookie is automatically set by us, our service providers, or our partners to recognize your browser as you navigate on the Internet and to present you with information and advertising based on your apparent interests. See Display of Advertising/Your Choices for more information about our online advertising practices and your choices. To help measure and research the effectiveness of website features and offerings, advertisements, and e-mail communications (by determining which e-mails you open and act upon).

Please note that if you refuse to accept cookies, you may not be able to access many of the travel tools offered on our sites. Our sites also may use Web beacons (also known as clear gifs, pixel tags or Web bugs), which are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, that are placed in the code of a Web page. We use Web beacons to monitor the traffic patterns of users from one page within our sites to another, to deliver or communicate with cookies, to understand whether you have come to our site from an online advertisement displayed on a third-party Web site, and to improve site performance. We also may allow our service providers to use Web beacons to help us understand which emails have been opened by recipients and to track the visitor traffic and actions on our site. This helps us measure the effectiveness of our content and other offerings. Display of Advertising/Your Choices. Data collected to serve you with relevant advertising TripAdvisor and its affiliated websites are committed to providing you with relevant content and information across our sites. To do this, we may collect information about your travel-related searches, such as whether you are looking for airline flights or hotels, and use this information to serve you with ads on our sites or elsewhere online that match your apparent interests. So, for example, if you search for a flight to Florida on TripAdvisor.com, you may see an ad for a Floridatravel package on TripAdvisor.com or on another website you visit. We do not share your personal information (such as email addresses) with unaffiliated third parties so they can serve you with advertisements. You can choose not to receive relevant online advertising on other Web sites, based on your travel-related searches on TripAdvisor.com by clicking here. Data collected by business partners and ad networks to serve you with relevant advertising Many of the advertisements you see on the TripAdvisor.com family of sites are served by TripAdvisor.com or its service providers. But we also allow third parties to collect information about your online activities through cookies and other technologies. These third parties include (1) business partners, who collect information when you view or interact with one of their advertisements on our sites, and (2) advertising networks, who collect information about your interests when you view or interact with one of the advertisements they place on many different Web sites on the Internet. The information gathered by these third parties is used to make predictions about your characteristics, interests or preferences and to display advertisements on our sites and across the Internet tailored to your apparent interests. Please note that we do not have access to or control over cookies or other technologies these third parties may use to collect information about your interests, and the information practices of these third parties are not covered by this Privacy Policy. Some of these companies are members of the Network Advertising Initiative, which offers a single location to opt out of ad targeting from member companies. To learn more, please click here.

We will use the location information collected from your Device or photos to enhance your use of the Application.

You can change the privacy settings of your Device at any time, in order to turn off the functionality to share location information with the Application and/or the functionality to tag your photos with location information. If you have any queries about the privacy settings of your Device, we suggest you contact the manufacturer of your Device or your mobile service provider for help. Call Recording and Monitoring.

We may use your contact information to help others find your Twitter account, including through third-party services and client applications. Your account settings control whether others can find you by your email address or cell phone number. You may choose to upload your address book so that we can help you find Twitter users you know. We may later suggest people to follow on Twitter based on your imported address book contacts, which you can delete from Twitter at any time. If you email us, we may keep your message, email address and contact information to respond to your request. If you connect your Twitter account to your account on another service in order to cross-post between Twitter and that service, the other service may send us your registration or profile information on that service and other information that you authorize. This information enables cross-posting, helps us improve the Services, and is deleted from Twitter within a few weeks of your disconnecting from Twitter your account on the other service. Learn more here. Providing the additional information described in this section is entirely optional. Tweets, Following, Lists and other Public Information: Our Services are primarily designed to help you share information with the world. Most of the information you provide us is information you are asking us to make public. This includes not only the messages you Tweet and the metadata provided with Tweets, such as when you Tweeted, but also the lists you create, the people you follow, the Tweets you mark as favorites or Retweet, and many other bits of information that result from your use of the Services. Our default is almost always to make the information you provide public for as long as you do not delete it from Twitter, but we generally give you settings to make the information more private if you want. Your public information is broadly and instantly disseminated. For instance, your public user profile information and public Tweets may be searchable by search engines and are immediately delivered via SMS and our APIs to a wide range of users and services, with one example being the United States Library of Congress, which archives Tweets for historical purposes. When you share information or content like photos, videos, and links via the Services, you should think carefully about what you are making public. Location Information: You may choose to publish your location in your Tweets and in your Twitter profile. You may also tell us your location when you set your trend location on Twitter.com or enable your computer or mobile device to send us location information. You can set your Tweet location preferences in your account settings and learn more about this feature here. Learn how to set your mobile location preferences here. We may use and store information about your location to provide features of our Services, such as Tweeting with your location, and to improve and customize the Services, for example, with more relevant content like local trends, stories, ads, and suggestions for people to follow. Links: Twitter may keep track of how you interact with links across our Services, including our email notifications, third-party services, and client applications, by redirecting clicks or through other means. We do this to help improve our Services, to provide more relevant advertising, and to be able to share aggregate click statistics such as how many times a particular link was clicked on. Cookies: Like many websites, we use cookie technology to collect additional website usage data and to improve our Services, but we do not require cookies for many parts of our Services such as searching and looking at public user profiles or lists. A cookie is a small data file that is transferred to your computer's hard disk. Twitter may use both session cookies and persistent cookies to better understand how you interact with our Services, to monitor aggregate usage by our users and web traffic routing on our Services, and to customize and improve our Services. Most Internet browsers automatically accept cookies. You can instruct your browser, by changing its settings, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit. However, some Services may not function properly if you disable cookies. Log Data: Our servers automatically record information (Log Data) created by your use of the Services. Log Data may include information such as your IP address, browser type, operating system, the referring web page, pages visited, location, your mobile carrier, device and application IDs, search terms, and cookie information. We receive Log Data when you interact with our Services, for example, when you visit our websites, sign into our Services, interact with our email notifications, use your Twitter account to authenticate to a third-party website or application, or visit a third-party website that includes a Twitter button or widget. Twitter uses Log Data to provide our Services and to measure, customize, and improve them. If not already done earlier, for example, as provided below for Widget Data, we will either delete Log Data or remove any common account identifiers, such as your username, full IP address, or email address, after 18 months. Widget Data: We may tailor content for you based on your visits to third-party websites that integrate Twitter buttons or widgets. When these websites first load our buttons or widgets for display, we receive Log Data, including the web page you visited and a cookie that identifies your browser (Widget Data). After a maximum of 10 days, we start the process of deleting or aggregating Widget Data, which is usually instantaneous but in some cases may take up to a week. While we have the Widget Data, we may use it to tailor content for you, such as suggestions for people to follow on Twitter. Tailored content is stored with only your browser cookie ID and is separated from other Widget Data such as page-visit information. This feature is optional and not yet available to all users. If you want, you can suspend it or turn it off, which removes from your browser the unique cookie that enables the feature. Learn more about the feature here. For Tweets, Log Data, and other information that we receive from interactions with Twitter buttons or widgets, please see the other sections of this Privacy Policy. Third-Parties: Twitter uses a variety of third-party services to help provide our Services, such as hosting our various blogs and wikis, and to help us understand the use of our Services, such as Google Analytics. These third-party service providers may collect information sent by your browser as part of a web page request, such as cookies or your IP address. Third-party ad partners may share information with us, like a browser cookie ID or cryptographic hash of a common account identifier (such as an email address), to help us measure ad quality and tailor ads. For example, this allows us to display ads about things you may have already shown interest in. If you prefer, you can turn off tailored ads in Twitter account settings so that your account is not matched to information shared by ad partners for tailoring ads. Learn more about this setting and your additional Do Not Track browser option here. Information Sharing and Disclosure TipWe do not disclose your private personal information except in the limited circumstances described here. Your Consent: We may share or disclose your information at your direction, such as when you authorize a third-party web client or application to access your Twitter account. Service Providers: We engage service providers to perform functions and provide services to us in the United States and abroad. We may share your private personal information with such service providers subject to confidentiality obligations consistent with this Privacy Policy, and on the condition that the third parties use your private personal data only on our behalf and pursuant to our instructions. Law and Harm: Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Policy, we may preserve or disclose your information if we believe that it is reasonably necessary to comply with a law, regulation or legal request; to protect the safety of any person; to address fraud, security or technical issues; or to protect Twitter's rights or property. However, nothing in this Privacy Policy is intended to limit any legal defenses or objections that you may have to a third party’s, including a government’s, request to disclose your information. Business Transfers: In the event that Twitter is involved in a bankruptcy, merger, acquisition, reorganization or sale of assets, your information may be sold or transferred as part of that transaction. The promises in this Privacy Policy will apply to your information as transferred to the new entity. Non-Private or Non-Personal Information: We may share or disclose your non-private, aggregated or otherwise non-personal information, such as your public user profile information, public Tweets, the people you follow or that follow you, or the number of users who clicked on a particular link (even if only one did). Modifying Your Personal Information If you are a registered user of our Services, we provide you with tools and account settings to access or modify the personal information you provided to us and associated with your account. You can also permanently delete your Twitter account. If you follow the instructions here, your account will be deactivated and then deleted. When your account is deactivated, it is not viewable on Twitter.com. For up to 30 days after deactivation it is still possible to restore your account if it was accidentally or wrongfully deactivated. After 30 days, we begin the process of deleting your account from our systems, which can take up to a week. Our Policy Towards Children Our Services are not directed to persons under 13. If you become aware that your child has provided us with personal information without your consent, please contact us at privacy@twitter.com. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If we become aware that a child under 13 has provided us with personal information, we take steps to remove such information and terminate the child's account. You can find additional resources for parents and teens here. EU Safe Harbor Framework Twitter complies with the U.S.-E.U. and U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor Privacy Principles of notice, choice, onward transfer, security, data integrity, access, and enforcement. To learn more about the Safe Harbor program, and to view our certification, please visit the U.S. Department of Commerce website. Changes to this Policy We may revise this Privacy Policy from time to time. The most current version of the policy will govern our use of your information and will always be at https://twitter.com/privacy. If we make a change to this policy that, in our sole discretion, is material, we will notify you via an @Twitter update or email to the email address associated with your account. By continuing to access or use the Services after those changes become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised Privacy Policy.

This includes, for example, data identifying the actual location of a physical address using information such as GPS data, geocodes, latitude and longitude information, and images of the various locations.

The information we collect in this manner includes IP address, browser characteristics, device characteristics, operating system, language preferences, referring URLs, information on actions taken on our site, and dates and times of website visits. A cookie is a text file that websites send to a visitor's computer or other Internet-connected device to uniquely identify the visitor's browser or to store information or settings in the browser. A web beacon also known as an Internet tag, pixel tag or clear GIF, links web pages to web servers and their cookies and may be used to transmit information collected through cookies back to a web server. Through these automated collection methods, we obtain clickstream data, which is a log of content on which a visitor clicks while browsing a website. As the visitor clicks through the website, a record of the action may be collected and stored. We may link certain data elements we have collected through automated means, such as your browser information, with other information we have obtained about you to let us know, for example, whether you have opened an email we sent to you. We also may use third-party website analytics tools that collect information about visitor traffic on our websites.

Interest-Based Advertising On our websites, we may collect information about your online activities for use in providing you with advertising about products and services tailored to your individual interests.

Our privacy policy tells you about our information practices when you provide personal information to us, whether collected online or offline, or when you visit us online to browse, obtain information, or conduct a transaction. Personal information may include your name, email, mailing and/or business address, phone numbers, or other information that identifies you personally. We do not require you to register or provide personal information to visit our website. The policy includes detailed explanations of how we provide: Notice of our privacy practices, including Privacy Act rights › Your choices and preferences › Security features and service provider controls › How you can access your personal information › Where to submit inquiries › Web technology (such as cookies) to make the site operate effectively › Online protections for children › Key aspects of our privacy policy include: We do not sell or rent your personal information to outside parties. We do not market other products or services to you without your consent. We do not use web analysis tools (e.g., cookies) to identify you personally without your express consent. Notice of our privacy practices The following describes the ways we collect information from you, and the protections that apply to your information. The Postal Service collects personal information from you and from your transactions with us. We use information we collect to provide you certain products and services, and if needed to respond to your inquiries or requests for information. We occasionally collect data about you from financial entities to perform verification services and from commercial sources. We do this, for example, to prepopulate data fields in call centers to facilitate transactions, or to market products to consumers who have agreed to receive such messages. Privacy Act Rights The Postal Service follows the privacy requirements of the Privacy Act, which protects your personal information that we maintain in what is called a system of records. A system of records is a file, database, or program from which personal information is retrieved by name or other personal identifier. In other words, the Privacy Act applies when we use your personal information to know who you are and to interact with you – such as when you provide information to request a product or service, register on usps.com, or submit an inquiry or complaint. The Privacy Act provides comprehensive protections for your personal information. This includes how information is collected, used, disclosed, stored, and discarded. When we collect and maintain personal information from you offline, a Privacy Act notice will be provided. The following is your Privacy Act notice for personal information collected online: Privacy Act notice: Your information will be used to provide you requested products, services, or information. Collection is authorized by 39 USC 401, 403, & 404. Providing the information is voluntary, but if not provided, we may not process your transaction. We do not disclose your information to third parties without your consent, except to facilitate the transaction, to act on your behalf or request, or as legally required. This includes the following limited circumstances: to a congressional office on your behalf; to financial entities regarding financial transaction issues; to a USPS auditor; to entities, including law enforcement, as required by law or in legal proceedings; to domestic and international customs relating to outgoing international mail pursuant to federal law and agreements; and to contractors and other entities aiding us to fulfill the service (service providers). Click below for more information on Privacy Act protections. USPS Handbook AS-353, Guide to Privacy and Freedom of Information Act, and Records Management Information Collected from Emails and Online Forms Many of our programs and websites allow you to send us an email. We will use the information you provide to respond to your inquiry, provide information, or to fill your order for postal products and services in which you have expressed an interest. Remember that email may not necessarily be secure against interception. If your email communication is very sensitive, or includes information such as your bank account, charge card, or social security number, you should send it by mail unless the Web site indicates the particular site is secured. Back to Top › Information Collected and Stored Automatically We automatically collect certain information about your visit to usps.com. We limit the data collected to meet specific business needs and to fully protect your privacy. We thus may know what path(s) you took on usps.com, but we don’t know who you are. Except for authorized law enforcement investigations, we do not use this information to identify you personally without your express consent. We automatically collect and store the following information about your visit: General log information—Internet domain (for example, xcompany.com or yourschool.edu); Internet Protocol (IP) address; operating system; the browser used to access our Web site; the date and time you access our site; and the pages that you visited. We use the information to help us make usps.com more useful to visitors. We use it to learn about how locations on our site are being used, what information is of most and least interest, and to ensure usps.com can interface with the types of technology our visitors use. We also use the information to tell us of any possible site performance problems. Referral and statistical information where we have links or ad banners to or from usps.com. Such data may include aggregate data such as the number of click-throughs that occurred. It may also include specific data, such as whether you are a repeat visitor; whether you visited a page with a banner on it or clicked on an ad banner and then used our site (for instance, to register or make a purchase); the value, date and time of any sale; and the identity of the site which you linked to or from usps.com. We collect this information to know which links and banners are effective. For example, this allows us to determine which ads may be of most interest and to help us control how many times a specific ad is displayed. How Data Is Collected - Cookies and Other Web Analysis Tools We understand that you may have questions about Web technology and information that is collected as you surf or conduct business online. The Postal Service has very strict policies about Web analysis tools. Such tools include what are known as cookies and Web beacons. The Postal Service strictly limits the types of analysis tools allowed, the data collected, and how long the tools last, in order to best serve your business needs and also safeguard your privacy. The types of Web analysis tools we use are fully explained below, and in the attached letter from the Postmaster General. Read the Postmaster General's letter on Cookie Usage. Postmaster General's Letter on Cookie Usage PDF | HTM Cookies Cookies may be categorized as session or persistent, which describes the length of time that they stay on your system. Both session and persistent cookies are used on this site. The following are detailed descriptions of how we use these cookies. Session Cookies A session cookie is a small piece of textual information that a server places temporarily on your browser during the time your browser is open. The cookies are erased once you close all browsers. We use session cookies in the following manner: Log-on and log-off administration—If you decide to register with our site, so as, for example, to use one of our online services, session cookies help with the log-on and log-off process. The cookies enable us to recognize your log-on ID when you log on so that we do not establish a duplicate registration record for you. Transactions and site usability — We use session cookies to improve how you navigate through usps.com and conduct transactions. As examples, session cookies are used to maintain your online session as you browse over several pages; to store and prepopulate information so that you do not have to reenter the same information twice; to enable the postage rate calculator; and to retain your shopping cart information. Session cookies may also be used to collect referral statistics when you click on a link or ad banner to or from usps.com. Persistent Cookies A persistent cookie is a small piece of text stored on your computer’s hard drive for a defined period of time, after which the cookie is erased. We do not collect or link to personal information through persistent cookies without your express consent. We use persistent cookies as follows: Site usage measurement—Our site measurement tool uses a persistent cookie to assist us in measuring how and when our Web site and its various components are used. It functions as a “visit cookie,” so that we can determine if you are a repeat visitor to our site. This allows us to know if we are attracting new visitors and what aspects of the site seem most useful. The cookie will expire 30 days after your last visit. Log-off safety function—The USPS uses a persistent cookie to automatically log you off of usps.com if there has been no activity for 15 minutes. This is done for your safety to ensure that, if you have finished using our site, but have forgotten to log off, no one else can use your computer via your log-on and password. The cookie is permanently removed from your computer when you log off, or, if you have closed the browser without logging off, it is removed within 15 minutes from your last activity. Opt-in cookies—Persistent cookies allow us, at your request, to recognize you when you return to usps.com, or to remember certain information that you have provided us. The recognition feature allows you to log on to usps.com automatically, without having to enter your name and password each visit. The cookie assigns a random number to you, which we link to personal information you have provided and your purchase history. This allows us to personalize the site for you and tailor the content to your needs, for instance to show you other products you may be interested in. Other cookies allow us to remember certain information related to prior transactions, such as package tracking numbers, or mailing or address lists, so that we may prepopulate those fields for you on return visits. These features and cookies are strictly at your option and for your convenience. We will also present you with a convenient way to remove the cookies, via where you manage your account, if you decide later that you want to terminate one or more of these functions. The cookies will expire one year from your last visit. Ad banner cookies—On behalf of the USPS, persistent cookies and beacons (described below) may be set and managed by third party advertising suppliers to support ad banners. Ad banner cookies are set when you view or click on an ad banner on usps.com, or an ad banner on another site for a USPS product, and persist for no more than five years. Web Beacons A Web beacon, also referred to as a clear gif or page tag, consists of code on the USPS site that delivers a small graphic image from another Web site or third party server. They may not be visible as the beacon is generally a 1x1 pixel that is often designed to blend into the background of a Web page. We use beacons, often in conjunction with cookies, to monitor the effectiveness of ad banners; and to gather general log, statistical, and referral information. We do not use beacons to store or link to personal information. We thus use beacons to understand certain actions that you took (such as a purchase), but not to know who you are. Third Party Web Analysis Tools The Postal Service does not allow Web analysis tools to be used by third parties, except for service providers who help us in performing site analysis or providing a particular product, service, or advertisement. Service providers may use session cookies, just like the USPS does, solely to improve the use of the site. Service providers may only use persistent cookies and beacons if specifically approved by the USPS, which uses must comply fully with this policy. Data Derived from Web Analysis Tools We are careful to safeguard any data derived from cookies and beacons. No data derived from session cookies, or from the log-off persistent cookie, are retained. Data derived from other persistent cookies and beacons are retained behind the USPS firewall or a secure firewall of our service provider. Opting Out of Web Analysis Tools If you still have concerns about cookies, you may choose to opt out of their use. Ad banner cookies – You can opt out of ad banner cookies, without erasing or altering other cookies. If you opt out of these cookies, we will no longer track any information from ad banners related to a specific user’s visit. By clicking below, you will be taken to a third party site that explains how to opt out. Click here to learn how to opt out of ad banner cookie. Opting out of all cookies – You may choose to opt out of the use of all cookies. You will still be able to access most features of usps.com. However, certain features may not work as well or may be unavailable to you. You will not be able to register or purchase from usps.com because we need cookies to keep track of your shopping cart and to process your transaction. Click here to learn how to opt out of all cookies. Back to Top › Choice The Postal Service believes in permission-based marketing. We do not sell, rent, or otherwise provide your personal information to outside marketers. You will only receive marketing about products and services of the Postal Service or its partners, other than products and services you already receive or are registered for, under the following conditions. If you are a consumer, we use an opt-in standard. If you have provided personal information to register for or purchase a product or service, we will not use that information to contact you in the future about another product or service unless you have provided express consent. If you are a business, we use an opt-out standard. We assume you are interested in other products and services that could aid you in your business, and so we will provide information to you unless you tell us you do not want to receive it. Consumers may opt-in, and businesses may opt-out, when they register on usps.com and create a customer profile. These preferences in the profile can be changed at any time. Please contact the privacy office at the addresses below with any questions about your preferences. Back to Top › Security In those instances where we secure your personal information in transit to us and upon receipt, the Postal Service uses the industry standard encryption software, Secured Socket Layer (SSL). The URL in your browser will change to “HTTPS” instead of “HTTP” when this security feature is invoked. Your browser may also display a lock symbol on its bottom task bar line to indicate this secure transmission is in place. For site security purposes and to ensure that this service remains available to all users, the Postal Service employs software programs to monitor network traffic in order to identify unauthorized attempts to upload or change information, or otherwise cause damage. Except for authorized law enforcement investigations, no other attempts are made to identify individual users or their usage habits other than those uses identified in this policy. Unauthorized modification or misuse of information stored in this system will be investigated and may result in criminal prosecution. Service Providers The Postal Service enters into relationships with service providers in order to provide the highest quality product or service. Service providers may include an entity that provides assistance for the program, such as a call center; a provider of advertising services; or a partner for the program. The USPS holds service providers to the same rigorous standards of privacy that apply to the USPS, including being made subject to the Privacy Act and USPS privacy policies. Service providers that have access to personal information are also subject to security review. Back to Top › Access If you have provided personal information to us, you may request to review the information that we have maintained. Please contact the program office that provided you the product or service, the office that handled your inquiry, or the privacy office at the addresses below. We will correct or delete any inaccurate information upon your request. Back to Top › Inquiries We would like to hear from you if you have any questions or complaints regarding our privacy policy or use of your information. Please contact us at privacy@usps.gov, or mail us at: PRIVACY OFFICE US POSTAL SERVICE 475 L'ENFANT PLZ SW RM 9431 WASHINGTON DC 20260-1101 We will investigate and respond to your inquiry. Your inquiry will be treated confidentially and will be protected under the Privacy Act. Back to Top › Information from Children From time to time as part of a special Postal Service promotion, such as stamp collecting, we may request information from children under 13 years of age. We will do so only with parental notice and consent. We will take all necessary steps to protect the privacy and safety of any child participating, in accordance with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). Postal Service Collection of Information from Children We will post a notice that we are requesting information from children including the type of information, how we will use it, whether it will be forwarded to a third party, and a contact at our Web site for questions. We will utilize the information only for the given Postal Service promotion. We will not condition a child’s participation in an event on the provision of more information than is absolutely necessary for that promotion. An example of such a promotion could be a stamp-collecting program that might be of interest to children. Obtaining Verifiable Parental Consent We will use reasonable effort to obtain verifiable parental consent prior to the collection and use of personally identifiable information from children under 13. The method of parental consent verification may vary according to the event in which the child wishes to participate. Means of obtaining such consent may include, but are not limited to, offline consent such as printing and submitting a permission form by mail or fax, or online consent that contains a verifiable unique identifier such as a credit card. Parental Review The U.S. Postal Service will allow parents to review any personal information collected "
	+ "from their children, based on verifying the identity of the consenting parent. Parents may revoke their consent and delete information collected from their children at their discretion. The Postal Service will then stop collecting, using, or disclosing information from that child, and will end that child’s participation in that event if such information is necessary to continue. We will also alert parents if the event or activity changes either the type of information collected or the way in which the site uses the information. When Parental Consent is Not Required We do not require parental consent in order to collect and use online contact information to: respond directly to a child’s request on a one-time basis to a specific request where the information is not used to recontact the child for other purposes; request the name or online contact information of a parent for the sole purpose of obtaining verifiable parental consent or providing parental notification; respond more than once directly to a specific request from a child and not used to recontact the child beyond the scope of that request. Notification to Children The U.S. Postal Service will provide a prominent notice to children describing in age appropriate terms what personally identifiable information will be collected, and explain the need for those children to obtain parental consent before sharing their information.");

 	// utorrent Privacy Policy, http://www.utorrent.com/legal/privacy, retrieved 07/24/2013
	sessionStorage.setItem("TRAIND", "Privacy Policy   utorrent.com and various software applications and services provided through the utorrent.com website, are owned and operated by BitTorrent, Inc. BitTorrent, Inc. is committed to respecting the privacy rights and concerns of all users of our websites, applications and services. As such, we have established and implemented this privacy policy to inform visitors to the sites and users of the applications and services how we use and protect the information we collect. If you have any questions regarding this information or our privacy practices, please see the section entitled Questions? Contact Us at the end of this privacy policy. What information does µTorrent collect and how does µTorrent use it? How the µTorrent Client Works The µTorrent Client is a software application on your machine that manages downloads. It downloads files quickly by trading pieces with other users who are also downloading (or have downloaded) the same content. Your use of the µTorrent Client to download files will, in turn, enable other µTorrent users (or users of other clients that communicate using the Bittorrent protocol, including clients that are unaffiliated with BitTorrent, Inc.) to download pieces of those files from you. Although your IP address is associated with your piece of the file, other users will not have access to any other personal information about you. We do not track which files you transfer with the µTorrent Client. Merely using the µTorrent Client does not cause a record of which files you transfer to be kept by BitTorrent or BitTorrent on behalf of any third party. Gathering and Use of Anonymous Information Each time a visitor comes to one of our websites (including utorrent.com), we collect some limited information that your browser routinely makes available whenever you visit a website. We collect this data to improve the overall quality of the online experience, including product monitoring, product improvement, and targeted advertising. This information includes your Internet Protocol address, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your query and one or more cookies that may uniquely identify your browser. In addition to collecting these types of information, BitTorrent collects aggregate queries for internal reporting and targeted advertising. We also count, track, and aggregate the visitor's activity into our analysis of general traffic flows at our websites (e.g. tracking where traffic comes from, how traffic flows within the websites, etc.). To these ends, we may merge information about you into group data, which may then be shared on an aggregated basis with our advertisers; but BitTorrent will not disclose your individual identity or personal data without your permission. In the event that you provide us with answers to voluntary survey questions, we may present this information to our advertisers and partners, in the form of grouped statistics compiled from our users' answers to such questions. We also aggregate some data from our software applications (including µTorrent) regarding total traffic flows and content delivery performance of our Applications as well as other data collected in the use of our products or services in order to understand usability and monitor network conditions and compare the performance of Bittorrent and HTTP protocols on the public internet. End users may opt out of providing this information using a Preferences setting. Gathering and Use of Personally Identifiable Information You may visit the utorrent.com website and use the µTorrent application without any registration at all. However, from time to time, we may enable certain additional functionality whereby you will have to create a user account. When you register and create an account, we may require you to provide us your contact information including your name, address, phone number and e-mail address, and other demographic information (such as date of birth, gender, age and interests). Your user name and password will be used so you can securely access and maintain your account. We may also use e-mail addresses and other personally identifiable information from time to time in order to gather and provide to our members and visitors improved content and features. Notwithstanding any other term of this Privacy Policy, we may release any personal information we obtain or collect when we believe its release is appropriate to comply with the law, enforce our Site policies, or protect ours or others' rights, property, or safety. Spyware and Adware We oppose spyware and adware. Spyware is software installed on your computer without your consent or control. It can record and transmit your Internet activity and other personal information or change your computer's security settings. Adware is spyware that sends you unwanted pop-ups or spam. BitTorrent never uses these unwanted and harmful technologies. How does µTorrent protect customer information? We implement a variety of security measures to ensure the security of your personal information on our systems. User personal information is contained behind secured networks and is only accessible by a limited number of employees who have special access rights to such systems. Does µTorrent use cookies? Cookies are small bits of electronic information that a web site can transfer to a visitor's hard drive to help tailor and keep records of his or her visit to the site. The use of cookies is standard on the Internet and many web sites use them. Cookies allow web site operators to better customize visits to the site to the visitor's individual preferences. For example, by setting a cookie you would not have to log in a password more than once, thereby saving time. We currently save password information in cookies. In addition, advertisements displayed on the µTorrent Features may contain cookies. The companies who serve our advertisements transfer cookies independent of us, and, as such, we do not control the use of such cookies and in many instances have no access to the information collected by them. Although most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, you can usually change your browser to prevent that or to notify you when you are sent a cookie. Even without accepting a cookie, you can still access many, if not all, of the µTorrent Features. However, some parts of the µTorrent Features may not function properly if you refuse cookies. Does µTorrent disclose the information it collects from its visitors to outside parties? µTorrent does not currently sell, trade, or otherwise transfer outside the company personally identifiable information that visitors voluntarily provide in any registration or use of the µTorrent Features. This information is used to better understand visitors' use of the µTorrent features, to support related transactions made on or through the µTorrent features, and to better know our visitors and possibly tailor any specific features, promotions, or other notifications to them. However, this data in an aggregate form without any personally identifiable information may be provided to other parties for marketing, advertising, or other uses. Should you no longer wish to receive information from us, or should your information change, we have provided a way for you to correct, update or remove the personal data you gave us. You can do this simply by contacting us in any of the simple ways set forth below in the section entitled How do you change the information we have for you? Finally, we may disclose your personally identifiable information upon a transfer or sale to another entity of all or substantially all of our assets or equity securities or upon any other corporate reorganization. µTorrent's special note to parents. In compliance with the 1998 Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), utorrent.com is a general audience website, and does not knowingly collect, nor will it ever knowingly retain, personally identifiable information from any visitor µTorrent actually knows to be under thirteen years of age without the consent of that child's parent or legal guardian. How do you change the information we have for you? To update or modify the information that we have on file for you, if applicable, simply go to the µTorrent forums, log in, go to the Profile section, then modify your details and settings as necessary. Third party links and co-brand relationships. In an attempt to provide increased value to our visitors, we may choose various third party web sites or services to link to, and frame within, the Sites or Services. We also participate in co-branding and other relationships to offer e-commerce and other services and features to our users. However, even if the third party is affiliated with us, we have no control over these linked sites, each of which has separate privacy and data collection practices independent of us. Data collected by our co-brand partners or third party web sites (even if offered on or through our site) may not be received by us. As such, we have no responsibility or liability for these independent policies or actions, and are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of any such web sites. These linked sites are only for your convenience and you therefore access them at your own risk. EU Safe Harbor Compliance µTorrent adheres to the European Union Safe Harbor principles as set forth by the United States Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information covered by the Privacy Policy from the European Union. Notification of changes. By visiting the website or using the applications and/or services, you consent to the collection and use of information by us as set forth in this privacy policy. If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes within this page so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. Questions? Contact us. If you have any questions about our privacy practices, please do not hesitate to contact: BitTorrent, Inc. 303 2nd St. Suite S600 San Francisco, California 94107 End User License Agreements and Terms and Conditions. Please also read any applicable End User License Agreements and/or Terms and Conditions that apply to individual µTorrent Applications and Services.");

 	// Valve Privacy Policy Agreement, http://store.steampowered.com/privacy_agreement/, retrieved 07/13/2013
	sessionStorage.setItem("TRAIND", "Privacy Policy Agreement Valve® Corporation and Valve S.A.R.L (collectively, “Valve”) respect the privacy of its online visitors and users of its products and services. Valve recognizes the importance of protecting information collected from users and has adopted this privacy policy to inform users about how Valve gathers, stores, and uses information derived from their use of Valve products, services and online sites. This policy is current as of its last revision date. However, please note that this policy may be amended from time to time to reflect changes and additions to the privacy policy. Please check back for the most current version before relying on any of the provisions in this privacy policy. Collection of Information By using Valve's online sites, products, and services, users agree that Valve may collect personally identifiable information (as defined below). Valve will not share personally identifiable information with other parties except as described in this policy. Valve may also collect aggregate information and individual information. Aggregate information is information that describes the habits, usage patterns, and demographics of users as a group but does not describe or reveal the identity of any particular user. Individual information is information about a user or user’s machine that is presented in a form distinguishable from information relating to other users but not in a form that personally identifies any user or enables the recipient to communicate directly with any user. Valve may share aggregate and individual information with other parties without restriction. Personally Identifiable Information Personally identifiable information is information that can be used to uniquely identify a user, such as name, address or credit card number. You may be asked to provide personally identifiable information in connection with the use of Valve’s products, services and online sites. While Valve collects personally identifiable information on a voluntary basis, for certain products and services Valve's collection of personally identifiable information may be a requirement for access to the product or service or to process a user’s order. Use of Personally Identifiable Information Personally identifiable information is used internally by Valve to develop, deliver and improve our products,content and services. In addition, Valve may allow third parties performing services under contract with Valve, such as order or payment processors or merchandise warehouse and fulfillment services, to access and use personally identifiable information, but only to the extent necessary to provide those services. Valve will not share personally identifying information with third parties for marketing purposes. Valve may use personally identifying information provided by users to send information about Valve, including news about product updates, contests, events, and other promotional materials, but only if the users agree to receive such communications. In some situations, personally identifiable information that users input in connection with their use of Steam may be available to other users of Steam. For example, during the creation of a Steam account, Valve collects a user's email address and username, and at the user's option, first and last name. Some of this information is searchable and available to other users within Steam. Valve has no obligation to keep private personally identifiable information that a user makes available to other users via Steam or other Valve software, such as in multiplayer chat or other public functions. External websites and companies with links to and from Valve's online sites and products may collect personally identifiable information about users. Third party publishers may also collect personally identifiable information as a requirement of accessing their games or content. Valve's privacy policy does not extend to these external websites and companies or third party publishers. Please refer directly to these companies and websites regarding their privacy policies. Valve may release personally identifiable information to comply with court orders or laws that require us to disclose such information. In the event of a reorganization, sale or merger we may transfer personally identifiable information to the relevant third party. Children Under The Age of 13 Valve will not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from any person age 12 and under. Valve encourages parents to instruct their children to never give out personal information when online. Parents who are concerned about the transfer of personal information from their children may contact us. Cookies and Other Information on a User's Machine Valve’s products, services and sites may employ cookies and other technologies such as web beacons and pixel tags. Cookies are bits of electronic information that can be transferred to a user's hard drive to customize a person's use of a product or online site, keep records of a user's access to an online site or product, or store information needed by the user on a regular basis. Use of cookies is typically associated with websites. For example, when you sign in to Steam, Valve stores your user id and a combination of your IP address and time of login as a cookie on your hard drive. This cookie allows you to move from page to page without having to sign in again on each page. Similarly, if you enter information during your session, such as age verification data, this will be stored as a cookie and you will not have to re-enter such information during that session. We may also use third party web site analytic tools that employ cookies to collect certain non-personally identifiable information concerning use of our websites, such as referring web site addresses, page views and browser types. Valve also stores information on a user's hard drive that is used in conjunction with use of Valve’s products and services. This includes a unique authorization key or CD-Key that is either entered by the user or downloaded automatically during product registration. This authorization key is used to identify a user as valid and allow access to Valve's products, services and third party games. Information regarding Steam billing, a user’s Steam account, a user’s Internet connection and the Valve software installed on a user’s computer is uploaded to the server in connection with the user’s use of Steam and Valve software. Valve software automatically generates and submits to Valve bug reports upon a crash or other fault in the Valve software, services or Steam games. This automatically generated bug report information may include information about other software or hardware on a user's system. Valve does not associate and store the automatically generated bug report information with personally identifiable information. Any bug reporting information manually submitted by users (e.g. through Valve's Bug Reporter form) is associated and stored with personally identifiable information. Chat Forums, Etc. Valve's products or services may provide chat, forums, bulletin boards, or instant messaging tools to users. Any information that is disclosed in chat, forums or bulletin boards should be considered public information, and users who message one another may not know each other personally. Valve has no obligation to keep private personally identifiable information that a user makes available to other users or the public using these functions. Users should exercise caution when deciding to disclose personal information in public forums. Users should also be aware that game play information disclosed during multiplayer game play (e.g. player name and current player statistics) is public information and may be displayed to other users. Choice/Opt-out Valve gives users the option to receive promotional email communications from Valve. Users may opt out of these communications. Instructions for discontinuing receipt of promotional email communications from Valve will be provided in email communications to users. Storage and Security of Personally Identifiable Information Personally identifiable information provided to Valve by customers in the EU is controlled by Valve S.a.r.l, with place of business set out below. Valve Corporation acts as the data processor on behalf of Valve S.a.r.l. Personally identifiable information provided to Valve will be collected, processed and stored by Valve Corporation in the United States.

This Policy describes: How and why we collect your personal information. How your information is used and protected. When and with whom we share your information. The choices you can make about how we collect, use, and share your information. Notice and Scope of Our Privacy Practices Our goal is to provide clear, prominent, and easily accessible information about our privacy practices. This Policy applies to customer information we collect in the United States and Puerto Rico at Walmart retail stores (stores) and through our websites (for purposes of this Policy, websites includes our mobile applications). Walmart has specific Notices of Privacy Practices for its personal information practices relating to the Pharmacy and Vision Center operations in our retail stores. These Notices are available at each Pharmacy and Vision Center. Our Pledge of Accountability Walmart expects our associates and business partners to manage your personal information properly and maintain your trust. We have designated associates who are accountable for compliance with this Privacy Policy. Information We Collect We collect personal information about you to deliver the products and services you request and to help improve your shopping experience. We strive to limit the amount of personal information collected to support the intended purpose of the collection. Information You Give Us We collect personal information from you in a variety of ways when you interact with Walmart, both in stores and through our websites. Some examples are when you: Create an account on one of our websites; Make an online or in-store purchase from us; Use a gift registry or create a mobile shopping list; Conduct a transaction where we collect information, including when required by law (such as hunting and fishing licenses); Request customer service or contact us; Submit a Walmart related story, testimonial, rating or review, or other user-generated content that may be posted on the site; Participate in a contest, sweepstake, promotion, or survey; or Otherwise submit personal information to us along with any related content of the communication.

For certain transactions, we may be required to collect information to comply with legal requirements. Information from Other Sources We may receive personal information about you from other sources as well. Examples of these sources are entities that can help us correct or supplement our records, improve the quality or personalization of our service to you, and help prevent or detect fraud.

Beacons allow us to know if a certain page was visited, an email was opened, or if ad banners on our website and other sites were effective. We operate cameras in stores for security and operational purposes, such as to measure traffic patterns. Except for security purposes, we do not use these cameras to identify you personally.

Marketing Purposes From time to time with your consent, we may disclose information with carefully selected companies who may offer you products and services of interest. You may opt in to this sharing under the Your Choices section below. Business Transfers We may transfer any information we have about you in connection with a merger or sale (including transfers made as part of insolvency or bankruptcy proceedings) involving all or part of Walmart or as part of a corporate reorganization or stock sale or other change in corporate control. Your Choices Data Collection, Use, or Disclosure Walmart collects, uses, or discloses your personal information consistent with this policy. The method of obtaining consent is appropriate for the type of personal information being collected, used, or disclosed. For example, we will obtain your express consent (verbal, written, or electronic agreement) to collect, use, or disclose personal health information in accordance with law. In other situations, we consider consent to be implied, such as to use your email for marketing purposes, unless you opt out of these communications such as by unsubscribing. Marketing Preferences We want to communicate with you in ways you want to hear from us. Examples are newsletters, special offers, and new product announcements. We use the following standards for marketing communications: We use an opt-in standard for phone and text messages. We also use an opt-in standard for sharing personal information with third parties for marketing purposes. Opt-in means we will only conduct the activity with your express consent. We use an opt-out standard for email or for other communications like mail. Opt-out means we consider your consent is implied, but will stop the activity on your request. You can provide us with your marketing preferences by visiting the Privacy Preference Center. The Preference Center allows you to update or change your preferences about receiving marketing materials at any time. Or you may contact the Privacy Office as described in the Contact Us section below. If you contact us by email or mail, please be sure to include your full name, the types of communications you would like to receive or not receive, and your related contact information. For instance, if you would like to opt-out of mail, include your mailing address. Please allow sufficient time for your preferences to be processed. It may take up to 10 days to process your requests related to email and 4-6 weeks for other requests. Please be aware that, even if you have opted out of receiving marketing communications from us, we may still contact you for transactional purposes. Some examples are contacts for customer service, product information, service or reminder notices, or recalls. We may also need to contact you with questions or information regarding your order, such as regarding order status, shipment, or refunds. Credit Offerings The above marketing preferences do not apply to our credit card offerings since these are provided through our financial institution partner(s). However, you can choose to stop receiving prescreened offers of credit from all companies, including our prescreened offers, by calling 1-888-567-8688 or by going to www.optoutprescreen.com. Online Operations and Advertising You may exercise choices related to our online operations and advertising.

To learn more about cookies, including how to refuse cookies on your device, follow these links: Microsoft Internet Explorer Mozilla Firefox All About Cookies Adobe Flash Cookies Safari You may also opt-out of certain online advertising called interest-based advertising. Interest-based ads are ads that are served to you based on your browsing behavior. The goal is to show you ads more tailored to your interests. We may use how you browse and shop in order to show you advertisements on our website that are more relevant to your interests. As an example, if you browse for electronics with us or other sites, we may show you ads for electronics as you browse our website. Advertisements may relate to Walmart or our advertising partners.

You may see ads for Walmart on participating websites based on how you browse our website and those sites. We do not allow the network provider to provide your browsing behavior on our website to other websites. Learn more about interest-based advertising, including how to opt out. You may opt-out of either interest-based advertising on our website, or interest-based advertising on other sites, as described above. Other websites you visit may offer their own opt-out methods as well. If you do opt-out of interest-based advertisements, you may still see advertisements on websites you visit, just not ads based on your browsing behavior.

If you need assistance accessing records related to your Vision Center, Pharmacy, or financial services information, please visit the section below related to Privacy Protections for Specific Types of Information. How We Secure Your Information Securing your information is a company priority. Whether you are shopping on our websites or in our stores, we use reasonable security measures to help protect the confidentiality of personal information. Online Protections Your account information is protected by the password you use to access your online account. Please keep this password confidential. We also use a technology called Secure Sockets Layer (SSL). If your browser is capable of SSL (and most are), your account information will be protected during transport across the Internet. You can see a representation of this when you enter a secure portion of our online website (not including our mobile applications), which is any page containing any of your account information, where an image of a closed lock or a solid key should appear in the bottom bar of your browser window. If you click on this image, a small pop-up window displaying website security information will appear. This display indicates that your personal information is transmitted in encrypted form to a Walmart web server, not to some unknown or unauthorized server. Hard Copy and Electronic Storage Protections Personal information that is maintained in our offices or stores is subject to physical, administrative, and technical controls as well. Hard copies of sensitive personal information are maintained in locked locations or cabinets with similar restrictions for electronic storage. When disposed of, the information is shredded, destroyed, erased, or otherwise sought to be made unreadable. Privacy Protections for Specific Types of Information Pharmacy and Vision Center When you use our Pharmacies or Vision Centers, you may provide us with your health information so that we may process your request. We understand the sensitive nature of such information and respect your privacy by keeping it confidential in accordance with laws and our policies. Our privacy policies for personal health information describe how we protect the information and how you may access it. The policies are provided to you by the Pharmacy or Vision Center at the first time of service or can be requested at any time at your local Walmart. Financial Products and Services When you obtain financial products and services from us, we may collect and use certain financial-related information. We understand the sensitive nature of this information as well, and protect it in accordance with laws and our policies. Financial products and services include money orders, money transfers, credit card offerings, bill payment, and check cashing. Find out more about Financial Services Privacy. We protect payment card information we collect during transactions. We comply with industry standards that require safeguards for handling and securing customer information. These include using secure networks; encryption or other protection of cardholder data; physical and technical access controls; monitors and tests of security systems; and information security policies. Privacy of Children Online We are committed to protecting children's online privacy. Our websites are for a general audience and are not geared towards children. In order to protect the privacy of children, Walmart websites and mobile applications do not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13 without prior parental consent. Please contact us via the Contact Us section of this Policy if you believe we may have collected information from your child and we will work to delete it. Privacy of Mobile Applications Walmart's mobile applications may include functionality to allow you to create a shopping list, search or add products to a favorites list using voice input or text, or by scanning bar codes, check price or product availability and print coupons, browse, search and buy Walmart.com products, locate the nearest Walmart store, track orders, find aisle locations for items on your shopping lists, order prescription refills, and view, share and print your online photos. In addition to the information mentioned above, our mobile applications collect certain information automatically, such as the type of mobile device you use, the temporary or persistent unique device identifiers (sometimes called UDID) placed by us or our service providers, the unique identifier assigned by Walmart to your device, the IP address of your mobile device, your mobile operating system, the type of mobile Internet browsers you use, and information about the way you use our mobile applications. Additionally, our mobile applications collect precise information about the location of your device. You must first provide permission through your device before our mobile applications obtain such location information from technologies like GPS, Wi-Fi, or cell tower proximity (or a combination of these technologies). Walmart, and our service providers, may use and store this information, in combination with other location-based information such as IP address and billing or postal code provided by you at time of your mobile application registration, to provide enhanced location based services, such as store specific services, search results, and other content. To opt-out of the collection of location data, see below. We may disclose or otherwise make available personal information about you to service providers that help with the operation of our mobile applications. These providers may collect device-specific information, such as a unique device identifier, when you use our website or one of our mobile applications. This information will not be associated in any way with your account at Walmart or any personal information that identifies who you are. The device identifier is used to improve services within our mobile applications such as barcode scanners or speech recognition. We require our service providers to keep your information secure. In addition, our service providers may not use or disclose personal information for any purpose other than providing the services on our behalf. We may also work with analytics companies to help us understand how our mobile applications are being used, such as the frequency and duration of usage. To protect the anonymity of this information, we use an encryption technology to help ensure that these third parties can't identify you personally based on information they collect from our mobile applications or your use of them. These analytics providers may also have access to your device-specific information such as a unique device identifier. This information will not be associated in any way with your account at Walmart or any personal information that identifies who you are, and we require these service providers to keep your information secure. There are multiple options for users of our mobile applications to opt-out of the collection and of your precise location information: Opt-out of all information collection by uninstalling our mobile applications – You can stop all collection of information by our mobile applications easily by uninstalling the mobile applications. You may use the standard uninstall processes available as part of your mobile device or via the mobile application marketplace or network. Note: If you uninstall the mobile application from your device, the Walmart unique identifier associated with your device will continue to be stored. If you re-install the application on the same device, Walmart will be able to re-associate this identifier to your previous transactions.   You may at any time opt-out from further allowing us to have access to your location data by adjusting the permissions in your mobile device. International As a global company, Walmart has separate privacy policies for its international offices. Personal information about our customers may be processed and stored in the United States or any other country in which Walmart or our service providers maintain facilities. Globally, Walmart requires our family of companies to protect your personal information, regardless of where it is stored, in accordance with local laws and our policies.

	sessionStorage.setItem("TRAIND", "This version of the Privacy policy was approved in October 2008 by the Board of Trustees. Discussion and proposed changes are welcome on the talk page at Meta. It is requested that this notice be translated and linked from the footer (MediaWiki:Copyright) of every page. Contents [hide]  1 General Scope 2 The public and collaborative nature of the projects 3 Activities on Foundation projects 4 User accounts and authorship 5 Purpose of the collection of private information 6 Details of data retention 6.1 General expectations 6.1.1 IP and other technical information 6.1.2 Cookies 6.1.3 Page history 6.1.4 User contribution 6.1.4.1 Reading projects 6.1.4.2 Editing projects 6.1.4.3 Discussions 7 Access to and release of personally identifiable information 8 Disclaimer General Scope This policy covers personally identifiable information collected or stored by the Foundation on its servers in relation to the Projects and their communities. Consistent with its Data Retention Policy, the Foundation collects and retains the least amount of personally identifiable information needed to fulfill the Projects' operational needs. The public and collaborative nature of the projects All Projects of the Wikimedia Foundation are collaboratively developed by its users using the MediaWiki software. Anyone with Internet access (and not otherwise restricted from doing so) may edit the publicly editable pages of these sites with or without logging in as a registered user. By doing this, editors create a published document, and a public record of every word added, subtracted, or changed. This is a public act, and editors are identified publicly as the author of such changes. All contributions made to a Project, and all publicly available information about those contributions, are irrevocably licensed and may be freely copied, quoted, reused and adapted by third parties with few restrictions. Activities on Foundation projects In general, this Policy only applies to private information stored or held by the Foundation which is not publicly available. Interactions with the Projects not covered by this Policy include, but are not limited to, aspects of browsing and editing pages, use of the wiki email user function, subscribing and posting to Foundation hosted email lists, and corresponding with volunteers via the Foundation's ticketing system (OTRS). These interactions may reveal a contributor's IP address, and possibly other personal information, indiscriminately to the general public, or to specific groups of volunteers acting independently of the Foundation. Users may also interact with one another outside of Foundation sites, via email, IRC or other chat, or independent websites, and should assess the risks involved, and their personal need for privacy, before using these methods of communication. User accounts and authorship The Foundation does not require editors to register with a project. Anyone can edit without logging in with a username, in which case they will be identified by network IP address. Users that do register are identified by their chosen username. Users select a password, which is confidential and used to verify the integrity of their account. Except insofar as it may be required by law, no person should disclose, or knowingly expose, either user passwords and/or cookies generated to identify a user. Once created, user accounts will not be removed. It may be possible for a username to be changed, depending on the policies of individual projects. The Foundation does not guarantee that a username will be changed on request. Purpose of the collection of private information The Foundation limits the collection of personally identifiable user data to purposes which serve the well-being of its projects, including but not limited to the following: To enhance the public accountability of the projects. The Foundation recognizes that any system that is open enough to allow the greatest possible participation of the general public will also be vulnerable to certain kinds of abuse and counterproductive behavior. The Foundation and the project communities have established a number of mechanisms to prevent or remedy abusive activities. For example, when investigating abuse on a project, including the suspected use of malicious “sockpuppets” (duplicate accounts), vandalism, harassment of other users, or disruptive behavior, the IP addresses of users (derived either from those logs or from records in the database) may be used to identify the source(s) of the abusive behavior. This information may be shared by users with administrative authority who are charged by their communities with protecting the projects. To provide site statistics. The Foundation statistically samples raw log data from users' visits. These logs are used to produce the site statistics pages; the raw log data is not made public. To solve technical problems. Log data may be examined by developers in the course of solving technical problems and in tracking down badly-behaved web spiders that overwhelm the site. Details of data retention General expectations IP and other technical information When a visitor requests or reads a page, or sends email to a Wikimedia server, no more information is collected than is typically collected by web sites. The Wikimedia Foundation may keep raw logs of such transactions, but these will not be published or used to track legitimate users. When a page is edited by a logged-in editor, the server confidentially stores related IP information for a limited period of time. This information is automatically deleted after a set period. For editors who do not log in, the IP address used is publicly and permanently credited as the author of the edit. It may be possible for a third party to identify the author from this IP address in conjunction with other information available. Logging in with a registered username allows for better preservation of privacy. Cookies The sites set a temporary session cookie on a visitor's computer whenever a Project page is visited. Readers who do not intend to log in or edit may deny this cookie; it will be deleted at the end of the browser's session. More cookies may be set when one logs in to maintain logged-in status. If one saves a user name or password in one's browser, that information will be saved for up to 30 days, and this information will be resent to the server on every visit to the same Project. Contributors using a public machine who do not wish to show their username to future users of the machine should clear these cookies after use. Page history Edits or other contributions to a Project on its articles, user pages and talk pages are generally retained forever. Removing text from a project does not permanently delete it. Normally, in projects, anyone can look at a previous version of an article and see what was there. Even if an article is deleted, a user entrusted with higher level of access may still see what was removed from public view. Information can be permanently deleted by individuals with access to Wikimedia servers, but aside from the rare circumstance when the Foundation is required to delete editing-history material in response to a court order or equivalent legal process, there is no guarantee any permanent deletion will happen. User contribution User contributions are also aggregated and publicly available. User contributions are aggregated according to their registration and login status. Data on user contributions, such as the times at which users edited and the number of edits they have made, are publicly available via user contributions lists, and in aggregated forms published by other users. Reading projects No more information on users and other visitors reading pages is collected than is typically collected in server logs by web sites. Aside from the above raw log data collected for general purposes, page visits do not expose a visitor's identity publicly. Sampled raw log data may include the IP address of any user, but it is not reproduced publicly. Editing projects Edits to Project pages are identified with the username or network IP address of the editor, and editing history is aggregated by author in a contribution list. Such information will be available permanently on the projects. Logged in registered users: Logged in users do not expose their IP address to the public except in cases of abuse, including vandalism of a wiki page by the user or by another user with the same IP address. A user's IP address is stored on the wiki servers for a period of time, during which it can be seen by server administrators and by users who have been granted CheckUser access. IP address information, and its connection to any usernames that share it, may be released under certain circumstances (see below). Editors using a company mail server from home or telecommuting over a DSL or cable Internet connection, are likely to be easy to identify by their IP address; in which case it may be easy to cross-identify all contributions to various Projects made by that IP. Using a username is a better way of preserving privacy in this situation. Unlogged-in registered users and unregistered users: Editors who have not logged in may be identified by network IP address. Depending on one's connection, this IP address may be traceable to a large Internet service provider or more specifically to a school, place of business or home. It may be possible to use this information in combination with other information, including editing style and preferences, to identify an author completely. Discussions On wiki discussion pages: Any editable page can theoretically be the location of a discussion. In general, discussions on Foundation projects occur on user talk pages (associated with particular users), on article talk pages (associated with particular articles) or in pages specially designated to function as forums (e.g., the Village Pump). Privacy expectations apply to discussion pages in the same way as they do elsewhere. Via email: Users are not required to list an email address when registering. Users who provide a valid email address can enable other logged-in users to send email to them through the wiki. When receiving an email from other users through this system, one's email address is not revealed to them. When choosing to send an email to other users, one's email is displayed as the sender. The email address put into one's user preferences may be used by the Foundation for communication. Users whose accounts do not have a valid email address will not be able to reset their password if it is lost. In such a situation, however, users may be able to contact one of the Wikimedia server administrators to enter a new e-mail address. A user can remove the account's email address from his preferences at any time to prevent it from being used. Private correspondence between users may be saved at those users' discretion and is not subject to Wikimedia Foundation policy. On mailing lists: The email addresses used to subscribe and post to Project mailing lists are exposed to other subscribers. The list archives of most such mailing lists are public, and searches of public archives may be performed on the Web. Subscribers' addresses may also be quoted in other users' messages. These email addresses and any messages sent to a mailing list may be archived and may remain available to the public permanently. Via OTRS: Some e-mail addresses (such as info-en at wikimedia dot org) forward mail to a team of volunteers trusted by the Foundation to use a ticket system, such as OTRS, to respond. Mail sent to this system is not publicly visible, but volunteers selected by the Foundation will have access to it. The ticket system team may discuss the contents of received mail with other contributors in order to respond effectively. Mail to private addresses of members of Board of Trustees and to staff of the Foundation may also be forwarded to the OTRS team. These messages and e-mail addresses may be saved by members of the OTRS team and any email service they use, and may remain available to them. On IRC: IRC channels are not officially part of the Wikimedia Foundation and are not operated on Wikimedia controlled servers. The IP address of users who chat over such a service may be exposed to other participants. IRC users' privacy on each channel can only be protected according to the policies of the respective service and channel. Different channels have different policies on whether logs may be published. Access to and release of personally identifiable information Access: Projects are primarily run by volunteer contributors. Some dedicated users are chosen by the community to be given privileged access. For example, for an English Wikipedia user, user access levels to Wikipedia are determined by the user's presence in various 'user groups'. User group rights and group members are reachable in every project from the Special:ListGroupRights page. Other users who may have access to private identifiable information include, but are not limited to, users who have access to OTRS, or to the CheckUser and Oversight functions, users elected by project communities to serve as stewards or Arbitrators, Wikimedia Foundation employees, trustees, appointees, and contractors and agents employed by the Foundation, and developers and others with high levels of server access. Access to and publication of this information is governed by the Access to nonpublic data policy, as well as specific policies covering some of the functions in question. Sharing information with other privileged users is not considered distribution. Release: Policy on Release of Data It is the policy of Wikimedia that personally identifiable data collected in the server logs, or through records in the database via the CheckUser feature, or through other non-publicly-available methods, may be released by Wikimedia volunteers or staff, in any of the following situations: In response to a valid subpoena or other compulsory request from law enforcement, With permission of the affected user, When necessary for investigation of abuse complaints, Where the information pertains to page views generated by a spider or bot and its dissemination is necessary to illustrate or resolve technical issues, Where the user has been vandalizing articles or persistently behaving in a disruptive way, data may be released to a service provider, carrier, or other third-party entity to assist in the targeting of IP blocks, or to assist in the formulation of a complaint to relevant Internet Service Providers, Where it is reasonably necessary to protect the rights, property or safety of the Wikimedia Foundation, its users or the public. Except as described above, Wikimedia policy does not permit distribution of personally identifiable information under any circumstances. Third-party access and notifying registered users when receiving legal process: As a general principle, the access to, and retention of, personally identifiable data in all projects should be minimal and should be used only internally to serve the well-being of the projects. Occasionally, however, the Foundation may receive a subpoena or other compulsory request from a law-enforcement agency or a court or equivalent government body that requests the disclosure of information about a registered user, and may be compelled by law to comply with the request. In the event of such a legally compulsory request, the Foundation will attempt to notify the affected user within three business days after the arrival of such subpoena by sending a notice by email to the email address (if any) that the affected user has listed in his or her user preferences. The Foundation cannot advise a user receiving such a notification regarding the law or an appropriate response to a subpoena. The Foundation does note, however, that such users may have the legal right to resist or limit that information in court by filing a motion to quash the subpoena. Users who wish to oppose a subpoena or other compulsory request should seek legal advice concerning applicable rights and procedures that may be available. If the Foundation receives a court-filed motion to quash or otherwise limit the subpoena as a result of action by a user or their lawyer, the Foundation will not disclose the requested information until Wikimedia receives an order from the court to do so. Registered users are not required to provide an email address. However, when an affected registered user does not provide an email address, the Foundation will not be able to notify the affected user in private email messages when it receives requests from law enforcement to disclose personally identifiable information about the user. Disclaimer The Wikimedia Foundation believes that maintaining and preserving the privacy of user data is an important value. This Privacy Policy, together with other policies, resolutions, and actions by the Foundation, represents a committed effort to safeguard the security of the limited user information that is collected and retained on our servers. Nevertheless, the Foundation cannot guarantee that user information will remain private.

 	// WordPress.org Privacy Policy, http://wordpress.org/about/privacy/, retrieved 07/13/2013
	sessionStorage.setItem("TRAIND", "Privacy Policy Roadmap Philosophy Statistics Website Visitors Like most website operators, WordPress.org collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. WordPress.org’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how WordPress.org’s visitors use its website. From time to time, WordPress.org may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website. WordPress.org also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. WordPress.org does not use such information to identify its visitors, however, and does not disclose such information, other than under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information, as described below. Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information Certain visitors to WordPress.org’s websites choose to interact with WordPress.org in ways that require WordPress.org to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that WordPress.org gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who use our forums to provide a username and email address. In each case, WordPress.org collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with WordPress.org. WordPress.org does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities. Aggregated Statistics WordPress.org may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites. For instance, WordPress.org may reveal how many downloads a particular version got, or say which plugins are most popular based on checks from api.wordpress.org, a web service used by WordPress installations to check for new versions of WordPress and plugins. However, WordPress.org does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information WordPress.org discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors, and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on WordPress.org’s behalf or to provide services available at WordPress.org’s websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using WordPress.org’s websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. WordPress.org will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors, and affiliated organizations, as described above, WordPress.org discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only when required to do so by law, or when WordPress.org believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of WordPress.org, third parties, or the public at large. If you are a registered user of a WordPress.org website and have supplied your email address, WordPress.org may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what’s going on with WordPress.org and our products. We primarily use our blog to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. WordPress.org takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration, or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information. Cookies A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor’s computer, and that the visitor’s browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. WordPress.org uses cookies to help WordPress.org identify and track visitors, their usage of WordPress.org website, and their website access preferences. WordPress.org visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using WordPress.org’s websites, with the drawback that certain features of WordPress.org’s websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies. Privacy Policy Changes Although most changes are likely to be minor, WordPress.org may change its Privacy Policy from time to time, and in WordPress.org’s sole discretion. WordPress.org encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy. Your continued use of this site after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.");

 	// Tumblr, Inc. Privacy Policy, http://www.tumblr.com/policy/en/privacy, retrieved 07/13/2013
	sessionStorage.setItem("TRAIND", "Privacy Policy Last Modified: 2012-03-22 Tumblr, Inc. (Tumblr, we, us, or our) takes the private nature of your personal information very seriously. This policy regarding our privacy practices (the Privacy Policy) describes how we treat the information we collect when you visit and use the website available at tumblr.com (the Site) and/or Tumblr's other domains, products, services, and/or content (collectively with the Site, the Services). When you use the Services, you are consenting to the collection, transfer, manipulation, storage, disclosure and other uses of your information as described in this Privacy Policy; please read it carefully. Also: This Privacy Policy doesn't govern what our users do on their own blogs and we aren't responsible for the information collection and use practices of our individual blogs and bloggers. One of the great features of Tumblr's products is customizability, and bloggers have a lot of flexibility in how their blogs behave. When you visit a blog in our network, that blog may collect more information than we do, and may provide information to third parties that we have no relationship with, including to advertisers. What This Privacy Policy Covers This Privacy Policy covers our treatment of information gathered when you are using or accessing the Services. This Privacy Policy also covers our treatment of any information that our partners share with us or that we share with our partners. This Privacy Policy does not apply to the practices of third parties that we do not own or control, including but not limited to any third party websites, services and applications (Third Party Services) that you elect to access through the Service or to individuals that we don't manage or employ. While we try to facilitate access only to those Third Party Services that share our respect for your privacy, we don't take responsibility for the content or privacy policies of those Third Party Services. We encourage you to carefully review the privacy policies of all Third Party Services you access. What Information We Collect and How We Use It Account Information: When you create an account on a Tumblr Service (an Account), you will provide information such as your username, password, and email address. You may also be required to provide us with your birthdate, which we use to verify your age and may use to personalize the Services for you (e.g., by presenting you with content relevant to your age group). This information may personally identify you. For example, if you use your full name as your username, you are disclosing your identity to the public. We also allow users to look for their friends by e-mail address; you can, however, opt out of this feature through your Account Settings page, and we do not expose your e-mail address to the public or third parties, except in the limited circumstances set forth in this Privacy Policy. Email Communications with Us: As part of the Services, you may occasionally receive email and other communications from us, such as administrative communications relating to your Account (e.g., for purposes of Account recovery or password reset). These communications are considered part of the Services and your Account, which you may not be able to opt-out from receiving. You can opt-out of most communications from Tumblr, such as new follower emails; please see your Account Settings page. Note that we will never email you to ask for your password or other Account information; if you receive such an email, forward it to us. Information about Your Accounts on Third Party Services: You can link your Account to certain Third Party Services. In order to do so, you will provide us with your username or other user ID on each of those Third Party Services. You may also be required to engage in an authorization process with each of those Third Party Services, where we receive a token that allows us to access those accounts so that we can, for example, when you choose, post your Tumblr content, or links to your Tumblr content, to those services. We do not receive or store your passwords for your Third Party Service accounts. Information Obtained from Third Party Services: In some cases, when you connect your Account with your accounts on Third Party Services, we may obtain information about you from those Third Party Services. Such information could include, for example, your gender, if you have disclosed that information to that third party and made it available for Tumblr to access. To the extent we obtain such information, we may use the information about you that we receive from Third Party Services to improve and personalize the Services. As a general practice, we strongly urge you to make careful judgments about any personal information you disclose to Internet services, including Tumblr and linked Third Party Services, regardless of whether you choose to link your accounts together. User Content: By default, all sharing through the Services is public, and when you provide us with content it is published so that anyone can view it. Although we do provide tools, like password-protected blogs, that let you publish content privately, you should assume that anything you publish is publicly accessible unless you have explicitly selected otherwise. Content published and shared publicly is accessible to everyone, including search engines, and you may lose any privacy rights you might have regarding that content. In addition, information shared publicly may be copied and shared throughout the Internet, including through features native to the Services, such as Reblogging. While you are free to remove published pieces of content from or delete your Account, because of the nature of Internet sharing, the strong possibility of Reblogging of your content by others, and technological limitations inherent to the Services, copies of that content may exist elsewhere and be retained indefinitely, including in our systems. Information About User Content: In some cases, we may collect information about content you provide to the Services. For example, when it's included with your images, we may collect information describing your camera and camera settings. This information allows us to improve the Services and provide additional features and functionality. Financial Information: We will sometimes collect financial information, such as information related to your payment method (valid credit card number, type, expiration date or other financial information), for example when you decide to purchase a paid Service. We do not, however, store that financial information; such information is stored by our third party payment processor (the Payment Processor), and use and storage of that information is governed by the Payment Processor’s applicable terms of service and privacy policy (the Payment Processor may also have other terms, and you are responsible for locating and familiarizing yourself with those terms, as applicable). We do receive certain information from our Payment Processor: (1) a unique token that we connect with your Account to enable you to make further purchases using the information stored by our Payment Processor and (2) in certain cases, the last four digits of the credit card number associated with that token, so that we can prevent fraudulent transactions and identity theft. Information Related to Use of the Services: We collect information about how people use the Services, including those with an Account. This information includes general usage information, and may include information such as the number and frequency of our visitors, which pages or features of the Services they have visited, which links on the Services they have clicked on, and the length of those visits. We may also use third party applications and services, such as Google Analytics and Quantcast, to collect and analyze this information. This information enables us and third parties authorized by us to figure out how often individuals use the Services so that we can analyze and improve them. Some of this information may be associated with the IP Address (as defined below) used to access the Services, and some may be associated with your Account, such as the topics you search for and the help pages that you visit. We may also use some of this information in aggregate form, that is, as a statistical measure related to all of our users that would not identify you personally. We use information about your use of the Services to improve and enhance your experience on the Services. Information Related to Your Web Browser: We automatically receive and record information from your web browser when you interact with the Services, such as your browser type and version, what sort of device you are using, your operating system and version, your language preference, the website or service that referred you to the Services, the date and time of each web request you make, your screen display information, and information from any cookies we have placed on your web browser (as described below). We also sometimes detect whether you are using certain web browser extensions and store that information in a manner associated with your Account. Web browser-related information is used to enhance your experience with the Services (for example, by personalization) and to allow us to improve the Services; it is not, however, used in a manner that would identify you personally. IP Address Information: Under certain circumstances, such as when you log into the Services, load a web page from the Services, or send an Ask message anonymously, we may collect and store your Internet Protocol Address (IP Address). We generally use IP Address information to fight spam, malware, and identity theft; we also may use it, in the future, to personalize the Services for you. IP Address information is also used by us to generate aggregate, non-identifying, information about use of the Services. Location Information: In some cases we collect and store information about where you are located, such as by converting your IP Address into a rough geolocation. We may use location information to improve and personalize the Services for you. Information Related to Your Mobile Device: We may collect and store information related to your mobile device, such as your phone number. You will have a choice as to whether we collect and store this information. We may use this information to improve the Services, such as by allowing you to verify your account by text message. Information Collected Using Cookies: Cookies are pieces of text that may be sent to and saved by your web browser when you access a website; your web browser stores these cookies in a way associated with each website you visit, and you can see your cookies through your browser settings. We use cookies to enable our servers to recognize your web browser and tell us how and when you use the Services. Our cookies do not, by themselves, contain information that personally identifies you, and we don't combine the general information collected through cookies with other such information to tell us who you are. However, we do use cookies to identify that you have logged in and that your web browser has accessed aspects of the Services, and we may associate that information with your Account if you have one. This information, in turn, is sometimes used to personalize your experiences on the Services, such as by presenting you with a different iFrame (allowing you to follow a blog) when you are logged in and visit a blog hosted by Tumblr. Most web browsers have an option for turning off the cookie feature, which will prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, as well as (depending on the sophistication of your web browser software) allowing you to decide on acceptance of each new cookie in a variety of ways. If you disable cookies, you won't be able to log into your Account, and so will not be able to use the vast majority of our Services; as such, we don't recommend disabling your cookies when using the Services. Some third-party services that we use, such as Google Analytics and Quantcast, may also place their own cookies on your browser, and individual blogs on our network may contain code that places their own cookies. Note that this Privacy Policy covers our use of cookies only and does not cover the use of cookies by third parties. Information About Your Contacts: Certain features of the Services allow you to provide us with your contact lists stored on other services, so that we can connect you with people in our Services that are also on those contact lists. For example, you can temporarily connect your e-mail contact information to your Tumblr.com account, so that we can provide you with a list of your e-mail contacts that use Tumblr.com. As another example, you can send us your mobile phone contact e-mails through our mobile applications, which then allows us to provide you with a list of those contacts that use Tumblr.com. We will give you an explicit choice as to whether or not you provide us such information, and we will disclose fully, within the appropriate feature, how we use, and whether we will store, that information. Derived Information: We analyze your actions on the Services in order to derive or infer characteristics that may be descriptive of you (for example, what kinds of blogs you like to follow). These characteristics are used to improve and personalize the Services. Email Tracking: We may place information in our emails to you (such as a web beacon) that allows us to measure our email deliverability. With Whom Your Information Is Shared We never share information we receive from you unless: (a) we have your permission to share that information; (b) we have given you prior notice that the information will be shared, and with whom; or (c) that information is aggregate information or other information that does not identify you. Information Shared with the Public Through the Services: As noted above, by default, content published through the Services is shared with the public, and this is an important feature of the Services. Such information includes, but isn't limited to, anything you choose to post on or submit to a public blog, including About information that may describe you and anything apparent in a posted photograph. Because this kind of information can be seen by anyone and may be indexed by search engines (like Google Search), you should be careful in what you choose to disclose publicly and make sure it is information you want to share with everyone. Information Shared Between the Services: We may, if possible, aggregate information about your use of multiple Services and use that consolidated information to improve how the Services operate, and to develop new Services. Information You Share with Third Party Services: You may access Third Party Services through the Services, for example by clicking on externally-pointing links. You may also choose to share information that you provide to us, like blog posts, with those Third Party Services (for example, by syndicating posts to Twitter or Facebook). This Privacy Policy only governs information we collect and you are responsible for reading and understanding those Third Party Services' privacy policies. Information Shared with Our Agents in Order to Operate and Improve the Services: In some cases, we share information that we store (such as IP Addresses) with third parties, such as our service providers, consultants and other agents (Agents), for the purposes of operating and improving the Services. For example, we may share information with service providers in order to fight spam, and third-party consultants may have access to information in the process of improving our processes and technology. Agents with whom we share such information for these reasons are generally bound by confidentiality obligations and, unless we tell you differently, our Agents do not have any right to use Personal Information or other information we share with them beyond the scope and duration of what is necessary to assist us. You hereby consent to our sharing of Personal Information with our Agents. Information Shared with Third Parties: We may share or disclose non-private information, Aggregate Information, or other non-Personal Information with people and entities that we do business with. Information Disclosed Pursuant to Business Transfers: In some cases, we may choose to buy or sell business assets. In these transactions, user information is typically one of the transferred business assets. Moreover, if we, or substantially all of our assets, were acquired, or if we go out of business or enter bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of us or our assets may continue to use your Personal Information as set forth in this policy. Information Disclosed for Our Protection and the Protection of Others: We believe in freedom of expression, and, to the extent reasonable, we try to protect our community from baseless legal demands. That said, we also reserve the right to access, preserve, and disclose any information as we reasonably believe is necessary, in our sole discretion, to (i) satisfy any law, regulation, legal process, governmental request, or governmental order, (ii) enforce this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Service, including investigation of potential violations hereof, (iii) detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues (including exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and spam/malware prevention), (iv) respond to user support requests, or (v) protect the rights, property, health or safety of us, our users, any third parties or the public in general, including but not limited to situations involving possible violence, suicide, or self-harm. Information We Share with Your Consent or at Your Request: If you ask us to release information that we have about your Account, we will do so if reasonable and not unduly burdensome. The Security of Your Information Your Account information is protected by a password for your privacy and security. You need to prevent unauthorized access to your Account and Personal Information by selecting and protecting your password appropriately and limiting access to your computer and browser by signing off after you have finished accessing your Account on the Services. We seek to protect your information (including your Account information) to ensure that it is kept private; however, we can't guarantee the security of any information. Unauthorized entry or use, hardware or software failure, and other factors, may compromise the security of user information at any time. What Information You Can Access If you are a registered user, you can access and delete most information associated with your Account by logging into the Services and checking your Account Settings page. Registered and unregistered users can access and delete cookies through their web "

Your California Privacy Rights: Under California Civil Code sections 1798.83-1798.84, California residents are entitled to ask us for a notice identifying the categories of personal customer information that we share with our affiliates and/or third parties for marketing purposes, and providing contact information for such affiliates and/or third parties. If you are a California resident and would like a copy of this notice, please submit a written request to the following address: 35 East 21st St, 10th Floor. New York, NY 10010. How to Delete Your Account and What Happens When You Delete Your Account If you want to delete your Account, you can do so from your Preferences page or by emailing us and providing proof of authority over the Account. What constitutes proof of authority will vary depending on the circumstances, but generally will require sufficient identifying information so that we can be confident you are the Account owner. Deleting your Account may not fully remove the content you have published from our systems, as caching of, backups of, copies of, or references to your Account information may not be immediately removed. In addition, given the nature of sharing on the Services, some of the public activity on your Account prior to deletion (such as Reblogs of your blog posts) may remain stored on our servers and accessible to the public. Changes to This Privacy Policy We may amend this Privacy Policy from time to time, using the process for modifications set forth in our Terms of Service. Use of information we collect now is subject to the Privacy Policy in effect at the time such information is used. Where to Direct Questions or Concerns If you have any questions or concerns regarding privacy using the Services, please send us a detailed message. Link to Prior Versions You will find a link to prior versions of our Privacy Policy below. We have stored these versions on GitHub, which will also allow you to compare different versions and see what terms have changed: http://github.com/tumblr/policy/commits/master/privacy-policy.txt ");

We may also employ other technologies including (i) web beacons, which allow Us to know if a certain page was visited or whether an e-mail was opened; (ii) tracking pixels, which allow Us to advertise more efficiently by excluding our current users from certain promotional messages, identifying the source of a new installation or delivering ads to you on other websites; and (iii) local shared objects also known as flash cookies, which help Us to prevent fraud, remember your in-game preferences and speed up load times.

Some messages, such as invites for friends to join you in a game, may include your name and profile photo. We may also send promotional e-mail messages and promotional SMS messages (Promotional Communications) directly or in partnership with parties other than Zynga. Each Promotional Communication will generally offer recipients choices about receiving additional messages. back to top 5 SHARING OF YOUR INFORMATION We will share your information (in some cases personal information) with third parties, that is parties other than Zynga, in the following circumstances: Third Party Service Providers We will provide your information to third party companies to perform services on our behalf, including payment processing, data analysis, e-mail delivery, hosting services, customer service and to assist Us in our marketing efforts.

In many Zynga games friends and other players will be able to see your game profile, which may include your name or a “game name” and your profile photo, which in certain cases can reveal your SNS User ID number or Zynga ID. For example, in Zynga Poker any other player may encounter your game profile, if you are playing at the same table. Access to a Zynga ID or your SNS User ID may allow others to view the public information associated with your related SNS or Zynga account. Other players may also be able to send you game requests or even friend requests through the related SNS’ communication channels. Advertising of Third Party Products and Services We do not actively share personal information with third party advertisers for their direct marketing purposes unless you give Us your consent. We may share (i) aggregated information (information about you and other users collectively, but not specifically identifiable to you); (ii) anonymous information; and (iii) certain technical information (including IP Addresses, MAC Addresses for mobile devices and mobile device IDs) to develop and deliver targeted advertising in the Service and on the websites of third parties.

Cookies refer to a capability built into all browsers that allow website to store data on a visitor’s computer for future use. Security features built into all browsers prevent this data from being shared across different websites, so a website can only access information that it already had knowledge of and previously stored. For more information on cookies and their use, visit http://www.aboutads.info/. Note that although Operative receives browser data from third parties, it never shares the browser data it collects with third parties. What is my current status? Your browser is currently accepting cookies from and is partcipating in Operative's services Can I choose not to participate? Operative and its customers understand that data collection using cookies can be perceived as a threat to visitor privacy and therefore provides a number of methods to opt-out, or disable data collection.

Visitors can also take advantage of browser settings and plug-ins to control your privacy preferences, as described here http://www.aboutads.info/consumers#browsers. Additional Details We store data using cookies exclusively (no other data storage methods are used) Technologies such as locally stored objects, HTML5 persitence, “supercookies”, flash cookies, fingerprinting etc., all serve similar purposes to cookies and can circumvent a consumer’s reasonable expectation of having opted out or otherwise controlled collection of data about their browser. We DO NOT use these technologies. We do not collect, store or share IP addresses. IP addresses are an essential part of web communications, but sometimes they can be used to identify a particular browser. We have designed our system so that we do not collect this information or store it. We do collect information that is derived from your IP address, such as the geographic region of your browser’s connection to the internet. We do not collect data that could be tied to sensitive data categories. We don’t categorize sites or pages or collect data based on past or current activity by browsers on adult or gambling sites, government agency sites, or sites directed at children under the age of 13 years or based on other inferred or actual sensitive information such as personal health or medical information, personal financial information, racial or ethnic origins, religious beliefs, the commission or alleged commission of any crime, political opinions or beliefs, trade union membership, or sexual behavior or orientation. We  keep individual browser level data for up to 18 months for auditing purposes. We keep the information that we do collect for up to 18 months for reporting purposes and in case a client needs to audit the data behind our reports. We may keep summaries of that data in a form that cannot be tied back to an individual browser for a longer period of time. Changes to our Privacy Policy We may revise this Privacy Policy at any time. You should visit this page periodically to review our current Privacy Policy so that you will always know what information we gather and how we may use that information.

 	// NLM Privacy Policy, http://www.nlm.nih.gov/privacy.html, retrieved 08/01/2012
 	sessionStorage.setItem("TRAIND", "NLM Privacy Policy The National Library of Medicine (NLM) provides this Web site as a public service. We do not collect any personally identifiable information (PII) about you when you visit our Web sites unless you choose to provide that information to us. We do collect some data about your visit to our Web site to help us better understand how the public uses the site and how to make it more helpful. NLM never collects information for commercial marketing or any purpose unrelated to NLM's functions.

NLM automatically collects and temporarily stores the following type of information about your visit: Internet address and domain from which you visited the NLM Web site Information about the operating system and browser used Date and time of the visit Pages visited Internet address of the Web site that connected you to the NLM Web site Words searched This information is used to measure the number of visitors to the various sections of our site and improve organization, coverage, system performance or problem areas. This information is not used for associating search terms or patterns of site navigation with individual users. When search features offer suggested terms, these suggestions are based on aggregated data only. NLM periodically deletes its Web logs. On occasion, NLM may provide aggregated information to third party entities it contracts with for the purposes of research analysis. Aggregated data cannot be linked back to an individual user. If your electronic medical record (EMR), patient health record (PHR) or other system links you to MedlinePlus, your diagnosis codes or other information, such as medications or procedures names, are sent to our site in order to link you to the most appropriate information. No personally identifiable information is collected in this process. We may review information in order to make improvements to our site and better meet user needs, but such information is reviewed at an aggregated level. Cookies When you visit any Web site, it may place a small text file, known as a cookie on your computer. The cookie allows the Web site to remember specific information about your visit while you are connected or when you return to that site. The Office of Management and Budget Memo M-10-22, Guidance for Online Use of Web Measurement and Customization Technologies (PDF*, 1.03MB), 6/25/10, allows Federal agencies to use session and persistent cookies, defined below. The cookie makes it easier for you to use the dynamic features of Web pages. Cookies from NLM Web pages only collect information about your browser's visit to the site; they do not collect personal information about you. While visiting certain NLM sites, you may occasionally encounter a Web page that automatically employs cookies to make it easier to use the dynamic features of these Web pages. NLM Web sites may use either single session (temporary) or multi-session (persistent) cookies. Session cookies last only as long as your Web browser is open. Once you close your browser, the cookie disappears. Persistent cookies are stored on your computer for longer periods. Session Cookies: We use session cookies for technical purposes such as to enable better navigation through our site. The OMB Memo 10-22 Guidance defines our use of session cookies as Usage Tier 1 – Single Session. This tier encompasses any use of single session Web measurement and customization technologies. Persistent Cookies: NLM uses persistent cookies to enhance the Web experience for our users. Persistent cookies remain on your computer between visits to NLM until they expire. The OMB Memo 10-22 Guidance defines our use of persistent cookies as Usage Tier 2 – Multi-session without Personally Identifiable Information (PII). This tier encompasses any use of multi-session Web measurement and customization technologies when no PII is collected. For example, NLM uses persistent cookies to enable a PubMed retrieval system feature called MyNCBI. The persistent cookie retains user preferences such as search result filters, LinkOut displays, institutional icon links, document delivery services, etc. across user sessions. Users may opt out of the persistent cookie selection in their MyNCBI settings at any time. NLM also uses persistent cookies to avoid repeated invitations to take the American Customer Satisfaction Inventory (ACSI) survey. The persistent cookies that block repeated survey invitations expire in 90 days. NLM may employ persistent cookies in other ways consistent with our mission and the OMB guidelines to analyze use patters and improve our users' experience on NLM Web sites. How to Opt Out or Disable Cookies If you do not wish to have session or persistent cookies placed on your computer, you can disable them at any time from your Web browser. If you opt out of cookies, you will still have access to all information and resources at NLM, but may be unable to use cookie-dependent features. Follow these instructions for disabling or opting out of cookies in the most popular browsers, http://www.usa.gov/optout_instructions.shtml. Please note that by disabling cookies from your Web browser, you will disable cookies from all sources, not just those from NLM. Personally Identifiable Information (PII) If you choose to send us personal information by email, or by filling out a form on our Web site, we use that information to respond to your message and to help us provide you with information or material that you request. If provided, personally identifiable information is maintained in a database that is regularly purged. Third party contractors may have access to this information in order to provide a response to your question or comment. These contractors are held to strict policies to safeguard the information and provide the same level of privacy protection as guaranteed by NLM. On occasion, we may conduct a study concerning the types of questions sent to us. These studies help us to improve our Web sites in order to make them more responsive to the needs of our users. We do not give, share, sell, or transfer any personal information to a third party unless required by law. Links to Other Sites Some NLM Web sites, such as MedlinePlus, provide links to other Internet sites that provide health information. Once you link to another site, you are subject to the privacy policy of the new site. Security The U.S. Government maintains this site. For site security purposes and to ensure that this service remains available to all users, we use software programs to monitor traffic to identify unauthorized attempts to upload or change information, or otherwise cause damage. Causing damage to federal computer systems is a violation of U.S. law and is subject to criminal prosecution in federal court. In the event of authorized law enforcement investigations, and pursuant to any required legal process, information from NLM Web logs may be used to help identify an individual. Third-Party Web Sites and Applications Third-Party Web sites and Applications (TPWA) are Web-based technologies that are not exclusively operated or controlled by NLM. They may be hosted on a non-government Web site or embedded on an NLM Web page. TPWA technologies may make personally identifiable information (PII) available to NLM, regardless of whether we request or collect it. In addition, other official Government Web sites we link to or cooperate with may use a third-party to handle some aspect of an information collection (for example: contest nomination process).

The purpose of this privacy policy is to disclose to you what information we may collect, how we may collect it, with whom we may share it, and certain other matters related to such information, including the choices you have regarding our collection of information and our use and disclosure to other parties of information we may have collected from you. Indianapolis Colts, Inc. has been awarded TRUSTe's Privacy Seal signifying that this privacy policy and practices have been reviewed by TRUSTe for compliance with TRUSTe's program requirements including transparency, accountability and choice regarding the collection and use of your personal information. The TRUSTe program does not cover information that may be collected through downloadable software.

When this privacy policy uses the term personally identifiable information or personal information, we mean information that identifies a particular individual, such as your full name, street address or email address. When other information, such as a favorite team or player, is associated with personal information, it also becomes personally identifiable information for the purposes of this privacy policy.

Your California Privacy Rights 12.    Questions About This Privacy Policy 1. Types Of Information That May Be Collected The following are the types of information we may collect: Information You Provide Us: In the course of using the website, we may ask you to provide us with certain information, including contact information, such as your name, mailing address, email address, phone number, unique identifiers such as your user name, demographic information such as your gender, and financial information, such as your credit card number or similar information. Personal Information means information that can identify a specific individual (including those under 13 years of age), such as your name, gender, address, phone number, e-mail address, or other contact information, whether at work or at home. Other information that we may collect, includes gender, age, first name, username and password that, in and of itself, is not personally identifiable. We do not save any Personal Information from users under thirteen-years-old except their parent's email address. We collect an e-mail address from each user in the registration process which protects the site from spam bots that search out and attack unprotected registrations. Our registration process delivers an e-mail to the registering user and then immediately and permanently deletes the email address of anyone under thirteen years of age. In the case where a user contacts us via the Contact Us area of the Website, we will respond to this one-time email and delete any email address that is associated with a user under the age of 13. Site Usage Information: We may receive and store certain types of internet usage information whenever you visit the Website, such as your landing page, order of pages viewed, and other click stream data. See IP Addresses and Click Stream Data section below. Email Communications: When you open emails from us, we may receive a confirmation noting you opened the email, if your computer supports such capabilities. We also may keep track of what emails we send you and what emails you may be receiving from our subsidiaries and affiliates. Additionally, we keep a record of what communications you have opted to receive or not to receive. Information from Other Sources: We may receive information about you from other sources and add it to the personal information we have collected. For example, we receive magazine subscription lists from the National Football League. 2. How Information May Be Collected We may collect information from you in several different areas on the Website, including but not limited to those described below: Registration: You may be asked to complete a registration form and provide personally identifiable information; you may also be asked to choose a user ID and password in order to take advantage of certain features the Website may choose to offer, such as newsletters or contests. Participation in registration is voluntary and you will have the opportunity to decide whether or not to disclose information to the Website. Certain functionality of the Website may require parental notice or consent for children under 13 years of age in order to comply with the Children's Online Privacy and Protection Act. When a member indicates that they are under 13 years of age, we will only collect first name, gender, parent's email address and birth date. Parents of users under 13 years of age will be sent a parental notice indicating their child's wish to join the Website, information about the activities on the Website, disclosure of the information collected from the child including username and password, as well as instructions for the parent to delete membership. The full privacy policy is also included in this notice. In such instances where parental consent is needed, we will direct you (the parent) to a web page explaining the procedure for obtaining parental consent. Features of the Website that require parental consent for children under 13 include, but are not limited to, the following: Permission to post a photo, artwork, video or essay that your child has submitted Permission to enter your child in a contest, sweepstakes or promotion Permission to allow us to use your child’s personal information to market the Website features and products directly to you. Children under the age of 13 who choose to participate in the above site activities will be asked to provide their first name only and the email address of a parent to obtain parental consent. Please note that a child’s participation or access to an activity cannot be conditioned on him/her providing more Personal Information than is reasonably necessary for that activity. A parent can review, change or, delete the Personal Information of his/her child at any time by emailing the child's username and parent's email address (associated with the account), and their request, to us at webmaster@colts.com. Newsletters and Website Emails: We offer free newsletters to share information with you about the Website, about us and our affiliates and subsidiaries, or about our marketing partners and advertisers and sponsors. You may receive a newsletter either by registering for a particular newsletter or in conjunction with a special feature or membership for which you have registered on the Website. Participation is voluntary and you will have the opportunity to decide whether or not to disclose information to the Website. You may also cancel your free email subscription by following the instructions provided on the Website or in the newsletter or email. You may also contact us at webmaster@colts.com. Contests or Sweepstakes: We periodically operate contests and sweepstakes through the Website that may require registration or the submission of personal information. Participation is voluntary and you will have the opportunity to decide whether or not to disclose information to the Website. Your personally identifiable information may be used to contact you for winner notification, prize delivery confirmation or other related purposes, (see the rules of each contest for details about how your personal information will be used). We may also ask your permission to allow us to publicly post some of your information on the Website, such as on a winner's page, in the event you win a contest or sweepstakes. Except as required by applicable law, we will not post your information without your permission. In some instances, a third party advertiser or sponsor may operate or host a contest or sweepstakes on the Website, and collect your information. In those cases, where we are not the operator or host of the contest or sweepstakes, we do not collect your information and we have no control over the information collected from you. Accordingly, we urge you to review the advertiser's or sponsor's privacy policy applicable to the contest or sweepstakes before participating. If a member is under 13 years old, their Parent will be asked to provide certain Personal Information so that the member may be prize eligible. Participation in these promotions, contests and sweepstakes is completely voluntary. The requested information typically includes contact information, such as name, shipping address, e-mail address, and telephone number. If the parent does not provide permission to use the Personal Information, the member will not be able to participate in the promotion, contest or sweepstakes.. We will use the Personal Information provided to us only to notify winners and award prizes. Special Offers and Updates In certain instances, we will use your personal information to send you (or your parent) information about the Website features and products and other relevant offers, promotions, contests and sweepstakes that may interest you. If a user is under 13 years of age, the marketing materials will be sent to the parent's e-mail address that was provided by their child upon registration. If a user (or user's parent) no longer wishes to receive these marketing messages, a user can choose to opt-out of receiving them by following the instructions included in each communication, or by e-mailing us at webmaster@colts.com. A parent can also review, change or delete the Personal Information of his/her child at any time by emailing the child's username and the parent's email address associated with the account, and their request, to us at  webmaster@colts.com. Surveys or Voting: From time-to-time we may request personally identifiable information from you in conjunction with a survey or voting poll. Participation is voluntary and you will have the opportunity to decide whether or not to disclose information to the Website. Cookies: As with many Websites, our Website uses a technology called cookies. A cookie is a unique, random number that is stored in the browser on your computer. The cookie doesn't actually identify you, just the computer that is used to visit the site. Cookies automatically identify your browser to the Website whenever your computer is used to visit the Website. Cookies also let us know how many people visit our website and where visitors go on the site. In addition, cookies can let us know non-personally identifiable information, like what web browser is being used to access the website. For registered users, cookies can make using the Website easier for you by saving information such as your passwords or preferences. By tracking how and when you use the Website, cookies help us determine which areas are popular and which are not. Many improvements and updates to the Website are based on data obtained from cookies. Accepting cookies allows you, among other things, to personalize your experience on the Website. Cookies may also allow the Website to present to you advertising which may be of interest to you. If you do not want information collected through the use of cookies, your browser should contain an option that allows you to disable or delete cookie data at any time. Some areas of the Website, however, may not provide you with a personalized experience if you have disabled the use of cookies. The cookies are not tied to personal information. These cookies do not collect Personal Information and we do not combine information collected through cookies with other Personal Information collected to determine your identity, your e-mail address or other personally identifiable information, including information regarding those under the age of 13. Clear Gifs (Web Beacons/Web Bugs) Our third party advertising partner employs a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), that help us better manage content on our site by informing us what content is effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user's computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. We do not tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our customers' personally identifiable information. IP Addresses and Click-Stream Data: We may collect IP addresses and/or click-stream data. An IP address is a number associated with the service through which you access the Internet, like your ISP (Internet service provider), your company, or your university. Standing alone, your IP address is not personally identifiable. At times, we also use IP addresses for purposes of system administration and to report aggregate information to our advertisers and sponsors, for example regarding the frequency with which our guests visit various parts of our sites. We may combine this information with personally identifiable information. Click-stream data is information collected by our computers when you request Web pages from the Website. Click- stream data may include such information as the page served, the time, the source of the request, the type of browser making the request, the preceding page view and other such non-personal information. When analyzed, this data helps us analyze how visitors arrive at the Website, what type of content is most popular, what type of visitors in the aggregate are interested in particular kinds of content and advertising, and the like. Transaction Information: If you conduct a financial transaction with our Website, such as buy season tickets or official Indianapolis Colts merchandise, we will ask you to complete an order form that will request certain information from you, including contact information, demographic information and financial information. We will use this information to complete the transaction that you have requested, i.e., to deliver the information, products or other services that you order, and to invoice you. For your protection, such information is collected and stored through encrypted means. 3. How We Use The Information Collected As applicable, the information you provide to us may be used to: Contact you about the Website Contact you relating to your membership status as we use membership areas in the Website Confirm or fulfill an order you have made Inform you of a prize you have won; monitor or improve the use of the Website Customize the advertising and content you see Monitor compliance with our terms and conditions of use of the Website Maintain website security Enhance navigation Send you our newsletter Send you promotional material or special offers on behalf of our marketing partners and/or their respective affiliates and subsidiaries and other third parties. 4. With Whom The Information May Be Shared At times, we may share your personal information with others for various purposes. The following outlines the ways in which your information may be shared with others and the ways in which you may opt-out of having your information shared: The Website does not sell or rent the personal information of those under the age of 13. If we did share this type of information with third parties, as a parent, you would have the right to consent to the site's use of the child's Personal Information without having to consent to the disclosure of that information to third parties. Below are ways in which we do share your Personal Information: Compliance with Legal Authorities Anyone’s personal information, including that of children under the age of 13, may be transferred to third parties without notice to you in order to comply with applicable law, to cooperate with law enforcement agencies as required by a valid legal process (court order, subpoena), to protect our rights, or to protect the rights of other users of the Website. Agents: We employ other businesses, certain services and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Examples include fulfilling orders, sending e-mail, removing repetitive information from customer lists, Website analysis, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance, processing credit card payments, and providing customer service. They may have access to personally identifiable information needed to perform their functions, but may not use it for their own purposes, like sending you marketing offers about their products. Those businesses include: eSports Partners, http://www.indianapoliscoltsproshop.com; MBNA America Bank NA., www.nflextrapoints.com; www.applyonlinenow.com and others. You are submitting your information directly to some of these third parties even though the pages have the look and the feel of the Indianapolis Colts site, and their privacy policy may apply. Aggregate Information: We may share aggregate information, such as demographics and Website usage statistics, with advertisers, sponsors or other organizations. When this type of information is shared, the other parties do not have access to your personally identifiable information Opt-In / Opt-Out Offers: When you provide us with personal information, you may be presented with the opportunity to share your personal information with third parties for various purposes, such as receiving information or special offers. An opt-in/opt-out message will ask you if you would like your information to be shared. When you allow us to share your personal information with third parties, we require third parties who have access to that information to agree to abide by our current Website privacy policy.

Third-party ad serving enables us to target advertisements to you for products or Websites you might be interested in. Audience and Traffic Measurement Services allow us to collect anonymous traffic and behavior information from our Website by monitoring anonymous visitor activity. Our current policy is that we do not permit the Websites advertisers, sponsors and/or traffic measurement services to set and access their own cookies on your computer. Business Transfers: In the event that all or substantially all of our assets are sold or transferred to another party, or another transaction occurs in which your personally identifiable information is one of the business assets transferred, all personally identifiable information, (including that of those under the age of 13 ) that has been collected and saved may be one of the business assets we transfer.

Only those employees who need access to your information in order to do their jobs are allowed access. Our security policies are reviewed periodically and revised as required. 8. A Special Note For Parents Concerning Privacy The Website is a general audience Website. If  we collect personally identifiable information from children, we will do so in compliance with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (15 U.S.C. 6501 et seq.) including, without limitation, obtaining necessary parental consent. For more information about the privacy practices of an affiliated children's Website, such as NFLPlayFootball.com, please consult the privacy policy at the children's Website. The Children's Online Privacy and Protection Act of  1998 requires websites that store data from users under thirteen years old to inform parents about data storage policies and obtain parental permissions. Once given, parents may revoke those permissions at any time informing us of their decision. We strictly adhere to these requirements and will make every effort to meet and exceed the requirements mandated by law. http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/conline/pubs/buspubs/coppa.shtm. The Internet offers children wonderful educational and entertainment resources. Your guidance and involvement are essential to help ensure that children have a safe and rewarding online experience. We encourage you to visit the Direct Marketing Association's Web Website (www.the-dma.org) and explore the Get CyberSavvy! Program as well as the GetNetWise Website (www.getnetwise.org) to learn more about parental control tools. Parents of users under age 13 who provide consent for Colts Kids Club to collect, use or disclose the Personal Information of their children may request to refuse further collection and use, review, change or delete the Personal Information of their children collected on the site by emailing their children's username and their request, to us at webmaster@colts.com.

The parent’s or the child’s information will be retained for as long as the child’s membership is active or as needed to provide relevant services. If the parent wants to cancel the child’s account or request that their information (or that of their child) is no longer used to provide them with services, contact us at webmaster@colts.com. Personal information will be retained and used as necessary to comply with legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce agreements. 9.

Your California Privacy RightsA California privacy law that went into effect on January 1, 2005, allows California residents to obtain specific information about a business's privacy practices if it shares information with other companies for those companies' direct marketing purposes. As explained in this privacy policy, whenever you agree to let us collect personal information about you, we will always provide you with an option to prevent this information from being shared for non-administrative purposes with third parties. You can exercise this option at any time by following the steps outlined above.
